    <Content>In this final chapter, we would like to show how intermedial thought, as we conceive of it, is able to renew our approach to certain questions which are, or have been, at the heart of important debates in various research fields. We limit this study to two examples which seem to us particularly significant for our study. Firstly, we will focus on the digital in order to show how intermediality can help us to better understand this reality, its nature and its conjunctures. We will then reorient the discussion toward theater, a site of revaluation and major reforms throughout the Long 20th century (from 1880 to today). We will therefore focus on two concepts that have occupied, and continue to occupy, a considerable place in theatrical reflection: presence and theatricality.</Content>

    <Content>The word 'digital' has invaded the public sphere for about twenty years. We use it in everyday language, we talk about it a great deal in the media; for institutions – governments, universities, businesses – it is as a key word. The word had first been used as an adjective: 'digital document', 'digital communities', 'digital identities', 'digital economy', 'digital environment' [...] up until 'digital culture'. More recently, it has become a substantive: it is referred to as 'the digital' and even an 'object of analysis'.</Content>

    <Content>From the emergence of the term, which was related to technology and its explosive use in the 1990s, we have envisaged the digital in many ways, but each kind of discourse on this subject can be considered an attempt at a discretization that aims to institutionalize not yet adopted practices. In other terms, the digital is nothing other than the name by which we try to naturalize practices whose characteristics are not sufficiently clear to avoid entering into other adopted institutional categories. We can assert that there is not, even today, a discourse on the digital that is stable enough to consider it as a point of reference. Many, sometimes contradictory, parallel debates circulate in public space, none of which seem to generally converge in order to overtake others and thereby emerge as institutional discourse. It would otherwise be impossible – precisely because of the instability and the non-institutionalized nature of these debates – to analyze them, or even further, to simply establish an exhaustive list.</Content>

These three approaches do not really correspond to modes of critical or scholarly analysis, but they represent rather the collective imaginary surrounding the digital, the way of understanding this phenomenon which is particularly visible in mediatic and commercial discourse and which has a considerable impact on the general perception of technological changes.</Content>

Even if the technical possibilities for materializing this fantasy continue to develop and if the notion of virtual reality takes on a fundamental importance in industry discourse, notably since Oculus Rift's commercialization in 2016, this concept does not allow us to sufficiently describe the digital turn. We could say that if, in the 1980s with the invention of the concept of virtual reality by Jaron Lanier, this model seems to need to be the dominant model in computer science development, today it is clear that virtual reality concerns a very limited number of experiences among the multitude of information technology uses.</Content>

In other terms: in the 1980s and 1990s, one would have thought that recreational use would constitute a privileged use of emerging digital tools.

    <Content>Taking the place of the debate on parallel, virtual, fictive, fluid and navigable space – a series of terms tied to parallel space –, arises a debate on concrete, hybrid and inhabitable space. The digital is always considered a space, but a space that integrates with non-digital space by blurring the difference between physical and non-physical which characterize the first debate, as well as the one relating to the fictive and non-fictive. We can here notice an initial phase of naturalization: the notion of discontinuity, which would characterize virtual reality rhetoric, is replaced by that of continuity. The digital turn appears to be not so much a revolution, but rather something natural that has always been a part of social practices.</Content>

    <Content>This approach is tied to a series of debates that have developed, since the 1960s, in the field of Media Studies and in the field of Information and Communication Sciences. From this point of view, one tends to think of media as devices enabling communication between two poles – whether these poles be either living beings, machines or even conceptual structures. One therein develops models to define the communication process – as an exchange of information between two poles – and one tries to understand media as an in-between that, at the same time, renders possible and structures the communication. This debate is often accompanied by the principle of transparency and immediacy – and remains closely tied to a representational regime. One presupposes that there would be an 'ideal' communication wherein there would be no 'information loss' and that therefore there would be a perfect medium which is completely 'transparent'.</Content>

    <Content>Rhetoric relating to novelty does not, in reality, constitute an isolated and independent debate. It is more a general way of envisaging the digital, a way that also affects the two other debates mentioned here and that, in addition, is used to refer to many non-standard practices well beyond the digital turn. It is a debate that tends to identify elements that break with a hypothetical 'tradition'. Applied to the digital, this debate is based on the key notion of 'new technologies', whose paradox is easy to guess. Novelty can only be an ephemeral quality and can therefore not be acknowledged on a definitional basis. The adjective 'new' is therefore unrelated to the thing that it would like to characterize. Every technology has been 'new' during a certain historical moment within a certain community – as provocatively stated by the title of Carolyn Marvin's book </Content>

This exercise is obviously always characterized by an arbitrary aspect, as the caesura between two chronological moments – as far as it can be justified – is never without ambiguity and is, to an even lesser extent, based on consensus. The difficulty for historians to delineate historical periods serves as proof of this.

If we rely in part on analyses of this discourse, novelty is very often identified by two elements indicating 'progress': speed and simplicity. Novelty is, in other words, always understood in commercial discourse as an advancing of a teleological process that moves toward dreamlike perfection consisting in a technological device's complete transparency. It is transparency that we criticize in this book. The products are labelled with higher numbers indicating better versions (iPhone 5, 6, 7, for example) and each version 'exceeds' the preceding version often by improving the speed and offering increased simplicity.</Content>

    <Content>The debate on novelty allows us to better identify the origin of the need to make such common use of the word 'digital'. We maintain the theory that this word does not derive from a real revolutionary change that presents itself as a veritable chronological break – that it be produced with the arrival of the web in the 1990s or prior. No break disrupts temporal or historical linearity. Our history is continuous, it is its institutions that discretely alter it. In other terms, our practices change in time, and we modify our customs, our technologies, our way of relating to the world. And this change is continuous. It must also not be considered an evolution, as it does not move toward 'progress'; it is not teleological. Quite simply, our practices change. The institution standardizes practices because they are based on a state of things at a given moment. From the moment the institution crystallizes its standards, practices continue to change, until the moment that the institutions can no longer standardize them, as these practices have become too different. It is at this moment that the institution must change. And this change is done immediately – with a change of standards that can only be discrete. It is at this moment that we invent new words to describe the change. And it is at this moment that we begin to refer to revolution. There is therefore revolution – or at least a discrete and important change –, but of the institution and not of the practices.</Content>

    <Content> – techniques have changed, as have readership, the number of literate readers, economic and social conditions, etc. These changes create unease from within the institution, as these norms no longer correspond to the realities of these practices: practices distance themselves more and more from the way the institution represents and regulates them. It is at this moment that crisis unfolds and the need for institutional change emerges. The symptom of this crisis and of this need for change is the word digital, with which we name the disparity between real practices and those practices that are standardized by the institution. In this sense, the expression 'digital editing' names all the continuous changes that separate 18th century editing from today's editorial practices. With the expression 'digital editing', institutions try to take further stock of the state of practices in order to be capable of once again standardizing them so as to continue to manage them.

    <Content>This same debate applies to a large number of institutions: if we think of personal identity management, of teaching, of research, of art, of communication. In the case, for example, of creating university positions in 'digital literature', we witness a change in practices that require the creation of this label. We speak of 'literature' to refer to a certain number of practices that have crystallized over years and centuries. These practices evolve up until a time where the difference between what we mean by literature and what real practices are becomes too important to not pose a problem. The university does not know what to do with practices that do not enter into the institutional framework: they therefore begin to use the word 'digital'. In this sense, the digital has nothing – or very little – to do with computers. It may be revealed that information technology has played a role in the change of our practices, but this is not the primary role, and above all not the only one. This is why, in the end, digital literature does not refer to literature made by computers, but rather literature during the historical moment of computers. The expression 'digital literature' could be replaced by 'today's literature'. These are, in other words, practices that probably relate to literature but that diverge too much from institutionalized practices for us to simply consider them 'contemporary literature'.</Content>

    <Content>And yet this brings up a series of questions relating to the standardization process of practices, on the role of institutions, on their place in society. Institutions are, by nature, always behind the times. Their standardization is based on something that is always, by definition, outdated. Practices are always beyond foundational standards, they are always laden with an institutionalizing character that is creative and normative. Each time someone creates literature, they do something that is not really what we mean by literature but that redefines the meaning of 'literature'. And this creativity undermines institutional standards. Each time, the institution tries to catch up by changing. This change is what we can call 'institutionalization' or 'standardization' our even 'naturalization', as we have seen in the previous chapter. In the case of digital literature, for example, institutionalization consists in creating prizes for 'digital literature', classes, associations, editors that make 'digital literature' and so forth (we could also refer to the work done for a number of years by the </Content>

    <Content>). This institutionalization implies that new practices no longer seem foreign and deviant. They become normal. This also implies that norms are appearing. We begin to know what 'digital literature' is and therefore what it 'should' be. Prior to being institutionalized, alternative practices were by no means standard: they were simply practices that did not conform to institutional definitions. But after institutionalization, they begin to be standardized, regulated: we know what we must do if we want to reclaim the sector. This implies that creative and innovative practices will end up by moving away from a given definition and will again find themselves marginal to the institution.</Content>

    <Content>The standardization phase is, of course, necessary for being able to organize our society. And yet, there are two ways of standardizing practices: one is diachronic and the other synchronous. This means that we can try to standardize a very limited number of practices over a very long period (diachronic) or a very high number of practices over a very short period (synchronous). Let us think about the definition of practices that we assemble under the name of theater. We observe that human beings in many societies and for many centuries do something particular and very specific: they display their actions. We notice that very often this display of actions is done within a pre-defined setting, we notice the social role of this display of actions and the ensemble of (technical, cultural, anthropological) devices that structure these practices. All of this, we call 'theater'. With this word, we also try to define what the theater is; we try to structure it. We try to understand it and to standardize it so that we may manage its role in society. It is based on this institutionalization that we can create theaters, systems to subsidize theater productions, theater teaching programs, and so forth. The same reasoning applies to literature, cinema, television, radio. These are diachronic definitions of very precise practices. Obviously, institutionalization provides a snapshot: it disregards the differences between a heterogenous ensemble of practices in order to place them in the same group and name them. One could provide a degree of tolerance regarding the more or less important differences in order to assemble a more or less elevated number of practices (for example, by saying 'cultural activities', we group 'literary', 'theatrical', 'cinematographic' practices, etc.).</Content>

    <Content>Synchronous institutionalization consists in taking a very heightened number of practices relating to a very short time frame. In this way, we very often refer to what is known as 'culture', for example the culture of a period. Humanism, as a culture that characterizes the 15th and 16th centuries, assembles a series of very heterogenous practices that are nonetheless characterized by a common denominator, a kind of 'spirit of times'. We could say that religious cultures also enter into this type of institutionalization even if, in the case of religion, we group together a synchronous vision and a diachronic vision. But from a certain viewpoint, we could assert that it is important is to first standardize a very heightened number of practices in the present moment. What counts is that all of today's Christians behave in the same way in a determined situation. The fact that a hundred years ago things were different does not count for much. Of course, the daily actions of a Christian from a hundred years ago were very different from the actions of a Christian today, simply because the changing environment, social concerns, etc., were not the same. But the fact of being Christian today alters the ensemble of possible practices (one is Christian when one eats, when one makes art, when one works, etc.).</Content>

With the word 'digital', we define a very heterogenous ensemble of practices that, as its common denominator, takes place in our present historical moment. In using this word, we tend to converge all these practices, even if they are very different: posting a photo on Facebook or writing a scholarly article, purchasing an airplane ticket to go on vacation or live-tweeting during a rock concert... This convergence can be seen as a characteristic of contemporary culture. This is true and false at the same time. It is true from an institutional point of view: discourse on the digital tends to understand a very heterogeneous ensemble of practices as a unit, and it thereby converges them. In institutional discourse, a 'digital' expert will be consulted in relation to purchasing strategies for Google servers, just as he would be for psychological problems arising among adolescents using Facebook, or for the latest Houellebecq novel in which the author plagiarizes Wikipedia.

Clearly, this large presence of networks and the impact that these structures have on our societies are not the only features of the digital world.

Retracing the history of network culture would be impossible, as it has crossed our societies' entire history as we remember, for example, the road networks put in place by the Romans – a centralized network, of course, but one that aimed to facilitate the possibility of decentralization, a possibility on which the empire was thereafter founded.

In addition, understanding this long history of network culture is necessary for correctly analyzing the debates surrounding current technologies: informational networks have benefited from the infrastructures that have previously been created for other networks: notably the telegraph and railways. Optical fibre, for example, crossed the United States following the railway, as railway societies are the only ones to have been given permission to bury a cable across the entire width of a country in avoiding telecommunication societies by needing to ask permission from millions of different land owners. Therefore, the geopolitical issues tied to the construction of east-west railways in the 19th century have an impact today on Internet geopolitics.</Content>

    <Content>Another characteristic of the digital, or even, another force in play in the establishment of the mediating conjunctures that we call 'digital', leads us to the timeless opposition between two paradigms relating to our interpretation of reality: a representational paradigm and a performative – or if preferred, operational – paradigm. To put it simply, we can think about writing practices just as we think of forms of representations of the real, that is, a way to form a relationship between a signifier – writing – and a referent – the real, to which writing refers to. In this sense, we can think about writing as having a mimetic function and insert it into the series of representational forms, such as have been practiced and analyzed since Antiquity – from Plato to today. Within this context, the question to be asked would relate to the way linguistic acts correspond to their referents or, otherwise stated, the relationship between truth and fiction: is writing a faithful representation of the real or is it a fiction, such as the novel?</Content>

    <Content>To briefly explain, we could say that according to the performative paradigm, writing must be considered as an act producing the real. In other words, it is not a case of representing a reality, but of constructing it. Digital culture privileges this approach. When we write something on the web – and here we imply, by writing, all forms that produce a trace, and therefore also the fact of publishing a photo – we do so with an operational aim. We do not represent something, but rather we do something – on the web I buy plane tickets, I organize my bank account, I work, I buy a book, etc. Even when I write a review for a restaurant on Tripadvisor, I do this so I can do something: for example, to change the ranking of the restaurant in question or its visibility. In fact, I am in the process of producing the restaurant, of contributing to what this restaurant is – for example, a good or a bad restaurant, a fish or a meat restaurant.</Content>

    <Content>And yet, once again, it is easy to demonstrate that this tendency to privilege the performative paradigm, as a characteristic of our digital culture, was not recently invented. The two paradigms have always existed and the importance of one or the other, as well as their prevalence among common receptiveness, have not ceased to vary over the course of history, as we see in the differing conceptions of mimesis between Aristotle and Plato. For the former, mimesis has an exclusively representative function. For the latter, it functions as a structuring of the real. The mediating conjunctures that we crystallize using the word digital are, in fact, characterized by a pre-eminence of the performative paradigm, but this pre-eminence is only one of the forces in play in current mediating conjunctures.</Content>

All these characteristics are specific to digital writing. The idea of the anthology, which developed during the Alexandrine age in the 3rd century BC, consists in composing collections that are at the same time exhaustive – they give an overall idea of a literary form or of particular themes – and partial – as it is always the result of a selection.

Obviously, the anthology implies a fragmentary form, and the fragmentary form invites a non-linear structure. The question that herein arises is as follows: how to produce a non-linear form in using a paper support that is suited to linear writing? Compilers and copyists have found many solutions to this challenge: one of them is the use of scholia, which are comments in the margins that often create relationships between the different fragments. The fragments are organized in thematic order (the love epigrams, the death epigrams, the religious epigrams, etc.) and the comments are placed in the margins to identify the epigrams of the same author or those that speak of the same person or the same city. In this way, the scholia offer a non-linear organizational form. The </Content>

The hyperlink, the layering of different versions, systematic rewriting – plagiarism, pastiche, parody – have always existed and the digital has only absorbed these culturally ancient tendencies.</Content>

One sees it here and there in Egyptian lists, in Aristotelian catalogues, in the mnemonic rules of Florentine Neoplatonists of the Renaissance, in Leibniz's mathematical models, in the affirmations by the big names of the web: the world is made up of an enormous mass of information, the knowledge and cultivation of which could enable an almost complete mastery. It would therefore be possible to know everything, to foresee everything, to do everything.

    <Content>Not all information is entirely accessible to humans, even if we consider that information exists, that it lies somewhere – contained in a book, retained by a group of specialists or simply observable in nature – or that it is disseminated, hidden or even beyond understanding, and this is because of an inability wherein we find ourselves decoding and standardizing languages, coding, formats. The structural problem of the library derives from this observation. The library is a device that attempts to knock down one of two limits of the dream of complete knowledge: accessibility. In a library, all the information – or at least a lot of information – is accessible. But, even if complete accessibility were achieved, one other limit would remain: the concatenation of data, calculability. In other terms, once a person has access to a large mass of information, how can they cultivate it? Having access to millions of books, I can only make use of the information that I am capable of reading and retaining. In order to cultivate this information in its totality, the information would need to make up an object calculable by a huge machine that would automatically process them. The mathematization of sciences is an attempt to resolve this second problem.</Content>

    <Content>The ensemble of these ideas and tendencies combines today by giving way to conjunctures whose singular and novel aspect is not found in each of these ideas considered individually, but in their concentration in shared space. It is the combination of these ideas – as well as a series of others that may please us to identify and specify – within a particular technological and economic context that gives way to the digital turn. And yet, as we have highlighted, mediating conjunctures are not stable and cannot be 'identified'. The gesture of identification that we here propose is therefore necessarily arbitrary, as it consists in isolating certain characteristics in relation to others, and to purposefully 'isolate' our observational range. As in the case of a school of fish, we can limit our gaze to what occurs within the geometric shape of the school, or we can also see how it interacts with one or many external elements. And again, we can choose a more or less extended period of observation – synchronous or diachronic. In the same way, the digital turn is a way of demarcating a field of observation within our current society by prioritizing certain aspects. In reality, behind this crystallization we find a moving ensemble of forces and tendencies for which we can always retrace a continuous line of development.</Content>

    <Content>This surprisingly belated penetration is not the outcome of chance or of random heuristic negligence, it is largely explained by what we have called a 'mediatic resistance' occurring within the world of theater. The intermedialists affirm the primacy of relationships over the objects caught within the dynamic and the genesis of media practices and, above all, they place at the center of their preoccupations the question of materiality and the role of technology – the non-human. In doing so, they have done little to draw sympathy from a community who, for more than a century, have forged their identity based on the real-life actor (their voice, their body) and their 'direct' relationship, reputed as pure, true and natural, with another real-life person, the spectator. By rejecting essence (including that of theater) and binary oppositions – for example, the live versus the mediated – onto which dominant theatrical discourse is constructed, intermediality calls into question certain foundations of theater studies and invites us to redefine them. But this meeting also concerns circumstantial factors. Intermedial thinking was deployed at a moment when theater studies had hardly begun to emerge as a separate (university) discipline. It was therefore vital, in order for theater studies to assert its legitimacy, to distance itself from literary studies, a discipline from which they sought to free themselves.</Content>

    <Content>We now approach two subjects, largely discussed within theater studies, that illustrate the difficulty of understanding a stage-based and dramaturgic practice in full bloom. The intermedial perspective that we adopt allows us not only to measure the distance separating the stage's reality from theoretical discourse, to grasp its inadequacy, but also to identify some of its underlying causes. The notion of presence (and liveness) and that of theatricality thereby reveal a profound crisis which has not yet entirely subsided.</Content>

    <Content> a value which, from the outset must, in the spirit of its promoters, be situated at the hierarchical pinnacle of representational practices 'seen in action' (as in cinema, records, radio or television). Nobody today contests the fact that the theater is effectively a practice above all branded by living presence – the co-presence of actor and spectator – but the hierarchical conception of practices that were attached to this argument rest on the existence of stability and of the media frontiers that intermediality reduces to discursive constructions. However, from an intermedial point of view, the most important problem lies elsewhere: it derives from the oppositions and amalgams which form the foundation of thought relating to the concept of liveness. In defining this school of thought in opposition to the mediated, one ends up considering the live and the mediated as irreconcilable, destined to mutually exclude one another. As for the amalgams, the effects were equally pernicious. Here we will retain only that which has allowed a widening of the concept of liveness to that of 'nowness', a process that irreducibly associates presence with the ephemeral and confining it as such.</Content>

    <Content>This discussion purports only to highlight and to valorize that which, for more than two millennia, created essence and belonged to its episteme. But these arguments fit, in a much more prosaic way, within market-based principles. We therefore notice that, in Arthur Pougin's monumental 1885 dictionary on theater and its associated arts, which is among the first encyclopedic works on theater, presence is in no way referenced. Pougin does, however, methodically examine the semantic field of the word 'theater', from which he draws more than half a dozen meanings. None of them deal with presence, be it in relation to the actor or to the spectator. Pougin also dedicates a long and particularly insightful paragraph to 'theater art', but again, without alluding to the notion of presence.</Content>

The more anxiety thrives, the stronger the media resistance that nourishes it becomes. This was the case during the electrical era, and it remains perhaps even more so in our current historical moment. Technologies founded on the digital are supple and have a transformational potential clearly superior to that of electric technologies.

    <Content> It is obviously unlikely that the defenders of theater's 'essence' had read Benjamin and were inspired by the passages that he dedicated to Pirandello. We should instead notice that these preoccupations were well and truly circulating in this troubled time and that, for the defenders of presence, art is human, and therefore all non-human intervention – technology, as it happens – impoverishes it or, worse, betrays it. But contrary to Benjamin, the defenders of theater's presence cling to a dualist model, forgetting the advantages of reproduction that Benjamin nonetheless highlights. They cling to this simplistic logic where the 'reproduced' – that which corresponds to the mediated – suffers an unavoidable loss in relation to the original. They present theater performance as one of the ultimate spaces of resistance to the domination of mechanical reproduction. This theory sometimes seems supported by Benjamin himself.</Content>

Theater texts, manuscript notes, photographs, programs, posters, sometimes even elements of set design or costumes, technical and administrative documents, correspondence between creative participants, critical testimonies, all of these at first seem archivable, and researchers generally have access to these documents without too much difficulty. This is not the case for the direct sound recordings of representations (by cassette or reel-to-reel recorder) that began to be used in the 1950s, nor for direct video recordings that became widespread in the 2000s (thanks to the progress and accessibility of digital technology). Audio recordings are straight out neglected, the majority of them poorly stored and currently inaudible. Very often, they are simply discarded. More recent video recordings are difficult to access. The reticence of theater companies and creative teams to make them available is well known, especially when these recordings are not the object of any post-production editing or filtering and are made with the help of a single mounted camera.</Content>

The model that Ricœur develops does, however, merit underlining the centrality of the action that he rightly describes as 'mediation'. It is the constitutive triad of mimesis and the logical which binds these elements that have progressively led to the concept of theatricality. But associated notions of action or of mediation remind us that mimesis is a dynamic process and that within it there is a central dimension which is by nature performative.</Content>

    <Content>We have insisted on the fact that, all while rejecting essentialism and the idea of the existence of related irreducible invariables, we recognize that mediating conjunctures are differentiated at once from their nature and their effects. It is in this sense that we understand theatricality: it is the mediality of theater, that is to say that quality emerges from singular conjunctures that have the effect of producing a theater show or its components in a given spatio-temporal and cultural context. The processes, elements, conditions and agents required for the theater show to take place vary from one period to another, from one region to another, from one institutional framework to another, from one culture to another. Theatricality continuously evolves. And this relative instability gives rise to questions of an ontological nature that challenge institutional discourse. In fact, this instability has been and is translated again into a necessity where we find ourselves continuously redefining theatricality and shifting the boundaries between media practices.</Content>

    <Content>If it is undeniable that the different elements which enter into what constitutes theatricality vary, it is equally true that these defining elements are not exclusive to theater practice. We must therefore understand theatricality as a conjuncturing ensemble wherein not only are none of its elements necessary and permanent, but not one of them is exclusive to theater. The frontality principle associated with the Italian stage, for example, is not unique to theater, as it also applies to cinema, and to the magic lantern. In the same way, the concept of presence, which Henri Gouhier has elevated to the 'essential' quality of theater, also applies to dance, as we have just mentioned, as well as to the circus and to concert performances, but also to sporting events (when one attends in person). And this same concept of presence – or of live – has paradoxically allowed radio and television to differentiate themselves from cinema and to win popular favor.</Content>

This confirms that theatricality is tied to its historical period. We otherwise notice that the arrival of stage realism corresponds, in time, to a marked acceleration of research and of experimentation in the field of sound and image reproduction, that would give birth to the large electric media of the 20th century. In the mimetic logic that realist theater defends, theatricality does not disappear, but its effect of enlargement and of exaggeration diminishes to the benefit of a 'reliving' (of reality). The distance between the original and the reproduced therein achieves its most reduced form possible, according to the users of the period.</Content>

    <Content>Bolter and Grusin remind us, however, that transparency is neither the ultimate objective of mediation nor an inevitable and desired outcome, as opposed to what the reproduction technology industry has advocated for more than a century. Opacity, as the two authors demonstrate well, is omnipresent in history and if, as a whole, the need to experience an immediate relationship with what is represented – thanks to transparency – seems dominant, our fascination for the performance of mediation in work – which is a way to define opacity – never entirely disappears. It is in fact a reversal of this tendency that we witnessed during the decline of realism and the appearance of the avant-gardes. The principle of opacity has therefore gained legitimacy, the avant-gardes even made theatricality the substance and the concept of their shows. It thereby opened an age of 'theatricalized theater' that we will no longer cease to celebrate, first in restrained circles from Dada to Meyerhold, from Artaud to Brecht, then on a larger scale with postmodernity. For Postlewait and Davis, this change set in motion the progressive slide from 'representational' to 'presentational' [c556] and brought to the fore the performative dimension of mediation. We could add that this also marked the end of the domination of the traditional mimetic regime.</Content>

    <Content>Integrating the lessons of Mallarmé and Hegel, who sought to make language – and poetic language – an autonomous universe, a world in itself, the heavy theatrical machine therefore provided a self-sufficient stage universe. This negation of the referential world has conferred to theatricality an unequal status in history: it took on a positive value and was simultaneously the end and the means of performance. It also became a privileged object of study by semioticians, whose influence overrode the entire field of human sciences. The prestige of semiotics rebounded on theatricality and it is in this context, or because of it, that theater studies emerged. Until then, theater had been considered a literary genre and its study was principally limited to that of dramatic text and their authors. In the same way that presence had been recovered to impose an essentialist conception of theater, theatricality would rely on major institutional reform: we therefore note the emancipation of an integrated practice to a discipline, the rise of theater to the status of a completely separate field of university study. This brought out strange divides, including the separation of the object of study and the literary: the literarity (the text) confined to the departments of literature, theatricality (what is left) brought to theater studies. It is in this sense that we must understand the famous declaration of Roland Barthes, one of the most influential French critiques of the 1950s and 1960s, who is also one of the first theorists to use the word theatricality (from 1954): 'What is theatricality? It is theatre without the text, it is a density of signs and sensations that manifests on stage [...]'.</Content>

          <Content> talks about the actress Berma playing the role of Phaedra. At the heart of the analysis that he offers is a critique of the idea of theater as representation. The theater experience consists in once again rendering present an event that is no longer there. The actor would therefore represent a character, in a structure strongly opposing the subject and the object: an object represented and a subject representing. Merleau-Ponty's idea is, by contrast, that theater in no way engenders a representative structure. The relationship between actor and character can be considered as an explanatory example of what is produced in the chiasmus between visible and invisible.</Content>

It is not possible to see Phaedra on stage without Berma, but we can neither perceive Berma without Phaedra. Proust realizes this when he asserts that whatever he had studied in advance on Phaedra's role, which in principle would be the common ground of all the actresses that play Phaedra, to be capable of subtracting it, of not gathering it as the residue of Mrs. Berma's talent, he notices that this talent is only made with the role.</Content>

It is true that this idea, evoked by Barthes, of the progressive construction of meaning, that affects the domain of creation as much as that of reception, includes a major performative dimension (the term performativity had not yet entered into use in the mid 50s, at least in the theater domain), it is above all the removal on which Barthes's definition is founded – 'theatre without the text' – that made a lasting impression on our minds.

    <Content>With the avant-gardes and postmodernity burgeoning, the progressive abandon of the representational, in favor of the presentational, paved the way for a new approach marked by performativity and collaboration between practices – from interdisciplinary to multidisciplinary. It would have been logical that, in this context, the concept of theatricality would simply be enriched by a performative dimension, but two factors have inhibited this development. On the one hand, semiotic thought has had the effect of turning the attention of researchers from performativity to an in-between model (upon which the sign and mimesis are founded) which, in some regards, marks a regression. On the other hand, the marked interest of semioticians for theatricality had the paradoxical effect of disqualifying it: the loss of influence of semiotics renders the concept dubious and less respectable. But the cause of the decline was not related to the questions of identity evoked earlier: the appropriation of mediality (theatricality) by a discipline (theater studies) can only, in fact, bring us back to earlier identity reflexes in other disciplines, reigniting the essentialist flame: theatricality became the mark of theater expansionism and this remediation of the theater has been perceived as a threat to ontology in other practices, that is, as a 'betrayal'.</Content>

    <Content>Fried's initiative bears witness to two converging phenomena whose effects would heavily weigh on the field of theater studies, as well as on theater more generally. On the one hand, this call for 'survival' can only be insured by the 'defeat' of theater, that is by the repression of theatricality from within the field of theater. On the other hand, while the concept of theatricality seems to be diverted from its most negative connotations and benefitted, thanks to the prestige of semiotics and to stage practices themselves, from unequal recognition, Fried attacked it not only by relying on old prejudices, but in underlining the outdated nature of the concept. By inviting minimalist artists to trade presence for presentness, inspired by phenomenological thinking, Fried confirms the triumph of the presentational and, indirectly, of the performative.</Content>

    <Content> have not waited to successfully apply the analytical principles of performance to analyze theater shows, thereby publishing a major shift in the course of theater studies. This 'performative turn' has profoundly enriched the approach of theater performance and its components, centering the observation precisely on the flow of actions that are produced and the agencies that are deployed in all the production phases of and during the theatrical event. To the criteria of fidelity so closely tied to the representational, the tenants of performativity have opposed this to the authenticity of the experience of the performer, of course, but also that of the viewer-experiencer-user, rendered co-creator. He separates himself, on the one hand, from the image of the performer who (would) play his life; on the other hand, he distances himself from that of the actor who (would) represent one. Even if reality is not so simple – because it always remains a part of the representational in any stage show and in its components, because mimesis has never entirely disappeared – this double equation remains.</Content>

    <Content>This suggestion is more than appropriate. By opposing theatricality and performativity, and by privileging the latter at the expense of the former – under the pretext that the latter is true and the former is false or because the former is weighed down by a heavy negative connotations (from enlargement and falsity to the semiotic aura), or even because the latter continues to enjoy an immense prestige within the human sciences – theater studies have perhaps not but retraced the model of old binary categories that they themselves have endured. Are we thereby still a part of the presentational era? Things evolve. We observe a marked return of the character, that of the narrative and, with it, that of mimesis obviously in renewed but recognizable forms. If we think for example about specific processes of documentary theater or of the use and nature of visual and sound projections that henceforth accompany all productions. We can hardly imagine, today, a theater performance without a soundtrack and video projections have entered into stage use.</Content>

    <Content>To the question, 'does a theatrical performativity exist?', we respond 'yes'. All mediation is performative and, of course, a theatrical performativity does exist, and is constantly redefined. This theatrical performativity stems from an ensemble of mediating conjunctures that we call theatricality. Performativity is therefore neither the successor nor the substitute of theatricality; it is a component that is central and necessary because there is no mediation that is not performative. What distinguishes this performativity from other performativities is its theatricality, it is the ensemble of mediating conjunctures to which it is attached and which, in the best of cases, results in a theater show.</Content>

    <Content>The results of our analyses reinforce the hypothesis underpinning the notion of mediating conjunctures: it is impossible to identify a single and determined mediating conjuncture in abstracting other conjunctures which participate in the mediating process. Each act identifying the particularities of a mediation situation consists in 'isolating' mediating conjunctures, which are dynamic and have no frontier. The place of representational and performative paradigms, in the theater and in the digital turn, offers, in this regard, an illuminating an example.</Content>

    <Content>In this book, we have highlighted the increased strength of the performative paradigm at the expense of the representational paradigm. From an essentialist point of view, we could believe that we are living in an era when mediation forms are therefore characterized by this paradigm and that there is no longer a place for mimesis and for representation. And yet, the reality is more complex: identifying the actions tied to each of these paradigms only occurs as a result of a particular kind of observation of mediating conjunctures. This observation consists in isolating a vast movement in order to focus our attention on only one part of their complex and open structure.</Content>

    <Content>The 'digital turn' and the 'theater' therefore form 'parts' of mediating conjunctures which, in themselves, are not separated into discrete units. We can identify reoccurring forms in what makes up these conjunctures and, among its forms, it is in fact possible to notice a presence and a performative tendency. But we can just as well also turn our gaze to other elements and other reoccurrences. In this case, for example, we could associate the return of a character and of a narrative, in the theater domain, to the rapid development of virtual reality technology for fictional or entertainment purposes. We could therefore identify the emergence of a contradictory tendency to that of the performative paradigm, according to which mimesis is destined for a strong comeback due to the necessity of preserving the very possibility of producing a diegesis. So that one may tell a story, it is fundamental that the story's world be clearly separated from the world in which the reader or the spectator find themselves: it is necessary to put the reader and the spectator in a position to receive a representation.</Content>

    <Content>The contribution of the notion of mediating conjunctures offers the possibility of identifying patterns and attributing them to an ontological meaning. This refers not only to interpretations of reality: it is reality itself that is open to observation. But at the same time, reality is plural because it is made from mediating conjunctures that are simultaneously the context and the outcome of the actions of elements that are involved.</Content>

# From the Birth of Intermedial Thinking to the Concept of Remediation: The Mediatic Phase of Intermediality

## Introduction

Henry Jenkins, the keynote speaker at the founding conference of the
International Society for Intermedial Studies (ISIS), held in Cluj,
Romania in October 2013, opened his remarks by expressing surprise at
the turnout. It wasn't false modesty; he was genuinely baffled that the
250 intermedialists in attendance, few of whom were specialists in media
or communications, should be interested in his work and that of his
colleagues at MIT's Comparative Media Studies Program. The
intermedialists hailed from other disciplines in the social sciences and
humanities: literature, art history, cinema, music, video, theater,
linguistics, history, philosophy, anthropology. Two days later, the
author of *Convergence Culture* recovered from his surprise. At the end
of the plenary session that closed the first ISIS conference, he
remarked, 'I assume that what I have been doing for years is
intermediality or has something to do with intermediality'. To the
attendees, this was self-evident.

This telling anecdote speaks to a readily observable fact: intermedial
research is more common than one might think, but it often appears under
other names, and is dictated by disciplinary convention, institutional
constraints and editorial policies that occur in the parts of the world
where it is conducted.

Born in the wake of what Milad Doueihi calls the *great digital
conversion*[^02chapter1_1] and what is commonly referred to as the *digital
revolution*, intermedial studies are barely 30 years old. That's not
much, considering the dispersal and often isolation of the first
intermedial researchers, an isolation that was aggravated precisely by
the profusion of labels used to describe their subject matter. It took
almost 10 years – from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s – before bridges
were built between some of the research groups and the first
international research network began to take shape. And it was another
20 years before an international scientific association devoted to
intermedial studies was formed with the ISIS founding conference in
Cluj, October 24-26, 2013.

While the scattered emergence of intermedial thinking impeded the
discipline's growth, it also attests to the supranational and
supradisciplinary scope of the intermedial approach, and the ubiquity of
the gaps it addresses. Those gaps are not confined to the lightning-fast
digital invasion, which has radically transformed our lives since the
end of the 20th century, but existed during the pre-digital age, as
well. As Espen J. Aarseth observed in one of the foundational texts of
game studies,[^02chapter1_2] information technology did not make the cybertext
possible; cybertexts existed before computers and cybertextual thinking
dates back several millennia. In support of this assertion, Aarseth
shows how the famous Chinese book of changes, the *I Ching,* which dates
back to the Zhou dynasty (1027-256 BC), was already a cybertext. The
intermedial approach likewise investigates processes that extend into
the distant past. Researchers such as Peter Boenisch[^02chapter1_3] argue that
intermedial processes have existed since the invention of the alphabet,
and interartistic theoreticians[^02chapter1_4] regard the complex, ceaseless
relationships between artistic disciplines since antiquity as compelling
models of intermedial dynamics. One of the first propositions advanced
by the intermedialists was that the arts are media, indeed the oldest
media, and that intermedial phenomena date back tens of millennia.

The term intermediality first gained currency in Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Canada. Germany may be considered the birthplace of
intermedial thinking, while Canada was the site of the first scientific
research center devoted to it, the Centre de recherches
intermediales/Centre for Intermedial Research (CRI) at the Université de
Montréal, founded in 1997. However, for the reasons we have mentioned,
the term 'intermediality' remained confined to a small circle of
researchers, even as studies in the field, such as those conducted by
Henry Jenkins at MIT, proliferated. In other words, intermedial
reflection developed steadily and was constantly enriched, unbeknownst
to the researchers themselves. A few examples: in 2000, the American
researchers Jay David Bolter and Robert Grusin published what would be
considered a groundbreaking work in intermedial studies: *Remediation.
Understanding New Media*.[^02chapter1_5] The concept of remediation they develop is
at the heart of intermedial dynamics. But nowhere in their 295-page tome
do the words 'intermedial' or 'intermediality' appear. The same is true
of other seminal texts in the evolution of intermedial thinking in the
US since the late 1980s. In *When Old Technologies Were New*,[^02chapter1_6] which
may be considered one of the foundational texts of American intermedial
studies, Carolyn Marvin discusses how, as the use of electricity became
widespread in the 19th century, electrical media emerged by
cannibalizing each other, transforming interpersonal relationships and
social behaviour in the process. Her book came out at the same time as
the first essays by German intermedialists on related themes, but they
do not appear to have been aware of each other.

In 1999, as digital technologies were invading the theatrical stage,
Philip Auslander's iconoclastic book *Liveness: Performance in a
Mediatized Culture*[^02chapter1_7] took aim at the deep-rooted idea that the direct
physical co-presence (in the same place, in the flesh) of senders and
receivers in a venue such as the theater and technological mediatization
were irreconcilable. Auslander argued that those distinctions born of
the operation of electrical media in the late 19th century cannot
withstand the reality test: liveness may be mediatized and still be
live. In 2003, Jonathan Sterne published another key intermedial work:
not only did *The Audible Past*[^02chapter1_8] revolutionize sound studies, but it
also expanded intermedial analysis to the world of sound, uncovering the
full complexity of mediation processes and underlining the hazards of
transposing concepts from visual studies to sound studies. In *Always
Already New: Media, History, and the Data of Culture*,[^02chapter1_9] Lisa Gitelman
questions whether what were then referred to, by researchers and in
society in general, as 'new media' in the industry really were new.
Adapting and developing Derrida's well-known phrase, she contends that
all media were always already new. Gitelman's analysis was grounded in a
synthetic definition of media to which no intermedialist, in the US or
elsewhere, would have objected at the time. She also clarifies and
enriches, without naming it, the central concept of remediation, while
Alexander R. Galloway questions it in *The Interface Effect*[^02chapter1_10] and
Craig Dworkin investigates modes of mediation in *No Medium*.[^02chapter1_11] In
the same year as the publication of Galloway's *The Interface Effect,*
Erkki Huhtamo and Jussi Paikka's *What Is Media Archaeology?*[^02chapter1_12]
marked the arrival of media archaeology as a recognized scientific
discipline. Archeology is one of the main branches of intermediality and
the remediation model is one of its cornerstones.

Other important texts in narratology and studies of adaptation,
reception, electroacoustics, literature and the early cinema published
during this period also adopted an intermedial perspective, but none of
those books and articles that so shaped the development of thinking
about intermediality, not only in the US but around the world, contained
the word 'intermediality'.

The same observation can be made about intermedial studies in the
French-speaking world, with the exception of research activities in
Canada around the Centre de recherche sur l'intermédialité at the
Université de Montréal. Works by Philippe Marion on linkages between
media,[^02chapter1_13] by François Odin on the 'births' of cinema, by Jean-Luc
Déotte on the concept of apparatus[^02chapter1_14] and by the Toulouse group[^02chapter1_15]
on the concept of device explore issues in intermediality without
calling them by this name. Texts by Jacques Rancière on the medium and,
more recently, on the (emancipated) spectator,[^02chapter1_16] by Daniel Sibony on
the in-between[^02chapter1_17] and by Deleuze on cinema (particularly the crystal
image)[^02chapter1_18] made such important contributions to intermedial studies
that they would certainly warrant inclusion on any list of essential
readings in intermediality, but none were, at the time, published under
the banner of 'intermediality'.

This first observation leads us to a second. To this day, in the minds
of many observers of the social sciences and humanities in general, and
the field of arts and media in particular, intermediality boils down to
the junction of artistic practices, most often in the form of a
technology transfer from one practice to another: using projected images
in theatrical productions, turning movies into video games, using
photographs in literary texts, and so forth. Certainly, these are all
examples of intermedial dynamics, but intermediality is much more than
this, as we will show.

## Historical Overview

For nearly 20 years, up to the mid 2000s, intermedial research was
dominated by a fairly traditional conception of media, which we shall
discuss in a later chapter. Intermedial studies sprang from a paradox
that digital technology had lain bare: not only do media constantly
interact, but they are themselves the products of such interactions.
This singular dynamic became the focus of the intermedialists, who
sought to understand how, by what means and to what end it was produced.
But over the past 10 years or so, the picture has grown murkier as the
very concept of media has been challenged; indeed, whether such a thing
exists or has ever existed is questionable. The relatively brief history
of intermediality can therefore be divided into two periods: the
mediatic period and the postmediatic period. The first was founded on a
relatively traditional conception of media inherited from Marshall
McLuhan and communication theory. The second wrestled itself free from
that frame. The transition from one to the other illustrates
intermediality's arduous but successful struggle for emancipation from
the poststructuralist mindset from which it emerged.

As we understand it, intermediality refers at once to a field of study,
a dynamic and an approach.

-   As a field of study, it deals with complex, rich, polymorphous,
    multidirectional relations among 'mediating conjunctures'.[^02chapter1_19]

-   As a dynamic, intermediality is what makes the production and
    evolution of such 'mediating conjunctures' possible; it also leaves
    in its wake media residues, scraps of uncompleted mediation
    processes, the remnants of 'mediating conjunctures' that have passed
    into history.

-   Consequently, we call for an original approach that can yield a
    better understanding of this field and this dynamic.

For the first intermedialists, it was vitally important to grasp media
(to use the terminology of the day) as part of a larger dynamic from
which they drew their power. From the outset, therefore, the producers
and users of media played a central role in intermedial reflection, to
the same extent as the materiality of mediation processes. The early
intermedialists, particularly those interested in electrical media,
brought new and sustained attention to bear on the social environment
from which media emerge and on which they act. This interest in
sociality is worth noting because the first intermedialists were often
wrongly accused of technocentrism, when in fact they held that media
practices could not be dissociated from the individuals who were their
agents. The socialities associated with media or created by media – from
the first telephones to contemporary social networks – are not
comparable to traditional social classes nor to stable communities;
hence the neologism 'sociomedialities' is used to refer to these
socialities that are specific to media and shaped by the processes of
naturalization and universalization that traverse media.[^02chapter1_20]

Etymologically, the term intermediality derives from 'intermedia' which,
as its morphology suggests, refers to what is located between media. The
word intermedia was first used in the American neo-avant-garde in the
1960s. Dick Higgins, co-founder of the multidisciplinary artistic
movement Fluxus, is credited with coining the term. Higgins was a poet
and composer who was heavily influenced by John Cage. Through a series
of experiments that decompartmentalized disciplines, media, techniques
and technologies, and effected transfers between them, Higgins and his
Fluxus confederates produced works that would now be described as
intermedial, since they harnessed multiple media (or arts) – which is
characteristic of multimediality – for purposes of artistic production,
presentation and experience (when the work involved user experience).
Their approach was not entirely new, insofar as its creative logic was
consistent with that of the historical avant-garde and rested on a
thoroughly conventional conception of media. They understood a medium to
be a discrete entity, one that is identifiable, separable and relatively
stable and independent, as were the dominant electronic media of the
time (radio, television, cinema). In that 'pre-intermedial' age, media
were perceived as monads, defined sometimes on the basis of their
real-world effects, sometimes on the basis of their structure and
workings.

Friedrich Kittler,[^02chapter1_21] Frédéric Barbier and Catherine
Bertho-Lavenir[^02chapter1_22] subscribe to the first approach: they define media
by what they do. According to Kittler, 'a medium archives things,
transmits things or processes things'.[^02chapter1_23] For Barbier and
Bertho-Lavenir, a medium is

> \[a\]ny system of communication that allows a society to perform any
> or all of three essential functions: conservation, remote
> communication of messages and knowledge, and the updating of cultural
> and political practices.[^02chapter1_24]

These definitions make no mention of the material dimension of media or
the role of the user in the process. Éliséo Véron proposes a
structuralist approach that encompasses these factors:

> A medium is \[...\] a constellation composed of a technology *PLUS*
> the social practices of production and appropriation of that
> technology, when there is public access to the messages (regardless of
> the conditions of access, which usually involve payment).[^02chapter1_25]

Understood as the practical application of knowledge to a specific field
and the resulting ability to perform tasks, technology includes artistic
practices. While the arts are distinguished from 'other' media by
certain qualities and functions that make them, according to Lars
Elleström's term, 'qualified media', they are media nevertheless. The
elements Véron gathers under the heading 'technology *PLUS* practices'
roughly correspond to the general but highly complex concept of
'device', which is central to intermedial theory and which we shall
discuss later.

Like media archeologists, intermedialists attach considerable importance
to the question of practice and related protocols and values, which
often account for a medium's success or lack thereof. Practice is
inseparable from the concept of 'device'.

We should note here two fundamental aspects of intermedial thinking: the
question of usage, which belongs to the sociomedial dimension of media,
and the material side of all mediation, which belongs to the technical
and technological dimension. These are also the two facets of a device
in Foucault's sense. Lisa Gitelman's synthetic definition of media
embraces these elements:

> I define media as socially realized structures of communication, where
> structures include both technological forms and their associated
> protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a
> ritualized collocation of different peaple on the same mental map,
> sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation.[^02chapter1_26]

While stressing the importance of sociomedialities, Gitelman's
definition remains attached to the concept of structure inherited from
communication theory, which, as we shall see, intermediality has
gradually abandoned.

The word intermediality originally appeared in German
*(Intermedialität)*. It is believed to have been used for the first time
by media philosophers (e.g. Ole Hansen-Löve in 1983) and then spread to
media studies, where it was popularized by the German scholar Jürgen E.
Müller,[^02chapter1_27] a dominant figure in the foundational period of
intermediality, just as the word intermedia migrated from the artistic
practice of the Fluxus group to the realm of media theory.

> At that period \[the 80s\], the isolating tendencies of media theories
> and histories and the rather banal fact that no medium could be
> considered as a 'monade' have motivated me and also some other
> scholars to direct our attention towards the intricate and complex
> processes of media interactions or media encounters. The notion of
> intermediality was based on the assumption that there are no pure
> media and that media would integrate structures, procedures,
> principles, concepts, questions of other media which have been
> developed in the history of Western media and would play with these
> elements.[^02chapter1_28]

It was therefore in German media studies *(Medienwissenschaften)*, and
not in the artistic avant-garde, that this significant theoretical
advance was made, shifting media researchers' attention from media to
relations between media.

## Remediation, Central Concept in Intermediality's Mediatic Period

We have mentioned the original geographic dispersal of intermedial
studies as one explanation for the arduous, still-incomplete unification
of the field and its slow climb to recognition, but that was not the
only problem. The very term intermediality causes confusion. It is
marked, one might even say dated, by the historical circumstances under
which it arose. The combination of the prefix 'inter' and the stem
'media' initially attracted derision. Therefore intermedialists are
interested in what lies between that which is between: presumably, it
can't be much! While the premise is accurate – intermedialists do indeed
attend to what is between the in-between – the clearly false conclusion
illustrates the widespread initial distrust in academic circles of a
field that presented itself as an 'indiscipline'. It is true, however,
that the question of the 'in-between' and how it was conceived by the
intermedialists formed the basis for the emergence of intermedial
theory.

The scepticism about this focus on the in-between may have been due in
part to the confusion created by the prefix 'inter'. From the outset,
intermediality fit naturally enough into a quasi-chronological series of
terms that share its prefix: intertextuality, interdiscursivity,
interdisciplinarity, intersubjectivity. There was therefore a tendency
to situate it within a reassuring but largely false *telos.* But reading
intermediality in terms of the 'inter-' logic inherited from semiotics
and structuralism distorts its essence. That confusion was aggravated by
the juxtaposition of 'inter-' with 'media', which duplicated its
meaning. Some clarifications are in order here.

In a study of the concept of 'medium'[^02chapter1_29] – that which is at the
center, in the middle – Jacques Rancière stresses the order of
precedence implicit in the 'inter-' principle. It may seem obvious but
Rancière underscores that for there to be an in-between, there must be
two terms – two texts, two discourses, two disciplines, two subjects –
engaged in a mutual relationship in space, in time, in logic, in short
within a framework or system where an in-between can come between. The
French mathematician, philosopher and psychiatrist Daniel Sibony had
addressed the question several years earlier in *Entre-deux. L'origine
du partage*,[^02chapter1_30] an essay that may be considered a first attempt to
theorize the notion of the in-between *(l'entre-deux)*, a category from
which intermediality is distinguished but with which it was and remains
associated.

Sibony situates the concept of the in-between as an extension and
transcendence of the poststructuralist idea of difference: 'Until now,
we have lived and thought under the sign of *difference*' but
'fast-moving facts and events \[...\] mean we can no longer be content
with using difference as our reference point'.[^02chapter1_31] Sibony argues that
while the idea of difference is fundamentally valid, it is no longer
adequate to reality. Difference has lost its relevance and must
therefore be expanded to the in-between, an 'effective \[...\]
operator'[^02chapter1_32] that makes it possible to grasp the complexity of the
phenomena at work in the in-between. Sibony calls those phenomena trials
*(épreuves)*, for the in-between appears to him fraught with tensions
and rifts.

> Perhaps the trials of the in-between come down to movements of varying
> degrees of richness in which *an identity attempts to piece itself
> back together again,* to resolve itself (while believing it is
> resolving with others), to stand up like a Harlequin costume in the
> circus of the world \[...\] But beyond the piecing together that the
> in-between actualizes, it achieves full strength when, in its great
> burgeoning, it appears as an *origin* figure \[...\] which assumes or
> implies something other than rehashing an immobile 'in-between'.[^02chapter1_33]

We should note here in passing the nostalgic dimension of the origin
figure (the lure of putting the pieces back together again), which also
tinges discourse surrounding media and, in many respects, the work of
researchers in the field. This nostalgia is doubly paradoxical. The
advent of talking pictures, which was widely celebrated as a triumph of
technology, only restored the original, pre-existing unity of sound and
image as it is experienced in daily life (without technological
mediation). Technology 'pieced together again' what it itself had rent
asunder, since it had initially been incapable of reproducing sound and
image synchronously. In short, and this is the second aspect of the
paradox, the progress of media means that in the future we will be
better off – as we were before! We will return to this paradox later; at
this point, it should just be noted that the origin myth is not
unrelated to the myth of authenticity.

This idea of precedence, with its whiff of nostalgia, is precisely what
is problematic for intermedialists. In fact, it gave rise to the first
major epistemic break produced by intermediality and is what
distinguishes it from the other 'inter-' variants listed above. That
break relates to both the nature of the two poles that circumscribe the
in-between and their prior nature. While the 'medium' as defined by
Rancière is between, intermediality is interested in an in-between that
lies between other in-betweens. In this sense, the detractors' gibes
were quite on point. Yes, it's true, intermediality is interested in
what lies between that which is between, and that is actually a great
deal, immense, for there is nothing else: the two prior terms that bound
Sibony's in-between are themselves between. In short, we have a
between-two-betweens, and this is complicated by the fact that these
in-betweens are dynamic, alive and constantly changing. The
disappearance of the pre-existing, fixed poles that had been the
starting point not only has a destabilizing effect but ultimately
excludes any precedence and relegates the origin figure to mythology –
and with it the nostalgia for an (idealized) past we can seek to
recover.

The first intermedialists did not initially question precedence but –
and this was already a significant shift – they reversed its elements,
as Jens Schröter noted in 2012[^02chapter1_34] in a retrospective discussion of the
development of intermedial thinking.

> \[W\]e have to recognize that it is not individual media that are
> primal and then move toward each other intermedially, but that it is
> intermediality that is primal and that the clearly separated
> 'monomedia' are the result of purposeful and institutionally caused
> blockades, incisions, and mechanisms of exclusion.[^02chapter1_35]

As can be seen, Schröter does not go so far as to question the origin
figure defended by Sibony, nor the existence of media. He is content to
invert the usual order – which places the two poles first, and then the
in-between – and cast media as the product rather than the source of
intermedial relations.

Before considering the reasons for abandoning the idea of precedence, we
will look briefly at those 'blockades, incisions, and mechanisms of
exclusion' that are at the heart of the intermedial dynamic and were the
focus of researchers' attention during intermedial theory's mediatic
period. Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin aptly summarize this period
with the punchy slogan 'a medium is that which remediates'.[^02chapter1_36] Their
book *Remediation: Understanding New Media*, published in 2000 some 15
years after the emergence of intermedial thinking, is a milestone in the
brief history of intermedial theory that models the intermedial dynamic
for the first time. It is also a pivotal work that takes stock of the
progress of intermediality from the late 20th century to the dawn of the
21st and opens up new perspectives that are central to contemporary
intermedial thinking. Bolter and Grusin thus offer a rich synthesis of
mediatic intermediality while at the same time noting its weaknesses and
contradictions, heralding the next phase: postmediatic intermediality.

Basing themselves on Marshall McLuhan's maxim, picked up by Kittler and
many others, that 'the "content" of any medium is always another
medium',[^02chapter1_37] Bolter and Grusin contend that

> \[A medium\] appropriates the techniques, forms and social
> significance of other media and attempts to rival or refashion them in
> the name of the real. A medium in our culture can never operate in
> isolation, because it must enter into relationships of respect and
> rivalry with other media.[^02chapter1_38]

The remediation principle, which definitively excludes the possibility
of monadic media, goes beyond the intuitions of the first
intermedialists in that, while remaining focused on the development of
media, Bolter and Grusin shun questions of precedence and origin. If a
medium is something that remediates, then there can have been no first
remediation. Lisa Gitelman encapsulates this disconcerting logic, which
runs counter to tradition and to the Sibony / Rancière school of
thought, in a phrase we have already quoted: a medium is 'always already
new'. While it does not question the reality of media – on the contrary,
that is its basis – Bolter and Grusin's model understands media as being
in perpetual motion, perpetual remediation. Their emphasis is based
squarely on what a medium produces and what it is produced by. In this
sense, they substantiate Chiel Kattenbelt's suggestion that
intermediality is currently the most radical form of performativity.

That being said, Bolter and Grusin's conception of media remains marked
by the in-between, the medium being located between an independent
reality and the representation conveyed by the medium, which we call the
representational paradigm. For example, according to Bolter and Grusin,
remediation operates 'in the name of the real'. This is a key point, for
the relationship to reality that Bolter and Grusin defend has profound
implications for various aspects of the intermedial dynamic. Ultimately,
it sustains the notion that the medium, which both results from and
produces remediation, remains a discretizable entity and its operation
is limited to carrying, transforming or producing data, which is what
Lars Elleström calls a 'media container'.

Bolter and Grusin's conceptual apparatus – starting with the concept of
'immediacy', a quality they ascribe to some forms of mediation – is
built on this paradigm. By their definition, immediacy exists when
mediation is imperceptible to the user, who may thus believe himself or
herself to be in the presence of something which, in fact, is only being
represented. Immediacy ties in with another concept, media
'transparency': the medium disappears, or to be more precise its devices
and mediation processes are concealed. Here, Bolter and Grusin buy into
the art of illusion, into a logic that returns us to mimesis and repeats
the traditional arguments on which the media industry has constructed
its marketing strategies for more than a century: the promise of
'fidelity' and 'high fidelity' (to what is unclear), touted by the music
recording industry in particular since the beginning of the 20th
century. The visual reproduction industry's claims to steady progress
hinge on the same illusionistic rationale. Bolter and Grusin's phrase
'in the name of the real' must be read in this light.

Though Bolter and Grusin remain deeply indebted to the mimetic model,
they clearly are well aware that there are other forms of mediation that
do not refer to a tangible, autonomous reality outside of, detached
from, prior to and independent of the mediation process. Alongside the
logic of immediacy, they develop the idea of 'hypermediacy'. But while
the former is clearly explained, the argument supporting the second is
laboured and incomplete, illustrating both its complexity and the
difficulty Bolter and Grusin have in articulating it.

The concept of hypermediacy evokes the 'hypermedia' described by Ted
Nelson in his famous 1965 article 'A File Structure for the Complex, the
Changing and the Indeterminate'.[^02chapter1_39] Nelson uses the term in
conjunction with 'hypertext', a word he also coined. He pointed to the
then-novel fact that the computer makes non-linear document management
possible by hyperlinking content. That capability endowed media with an
additional, vitally important dimension: they could now assume mutable
structures that changed shape with every reading. To illustrate the
point, Nelson cited the example of non-linear arrangements of film
recordings that make them browsable in multiple dimensions, rather than
the two dimensions of linear sequencing. Bolter and Grusin's
hypermediacy is governed by the same logic.

The manifestations of hypermediacy are more diverse than those of
immediacy and do not summon any external reality. To clarify this first
fundamental aspect of the concept, it might be compared with an abstract
painting, which in theory refers to nothing save itself and its own
make-up (unlike a figurative painting, which despite its weighty
artifice-creating apparatus, including perspective, produces an
impression of reality). But hypermediacy is more than that. The
hypermedial image Bolter and Grusin use to illustrate the idea is a page
from the World Wide Web (unaccompanied by sound, in their example) that
displays on the screen the system of hyperlinks described by Nelson. The
page consists of disparate elements – letters, numbers, icons, photos,
images of all kinds, fixed and moving – that share screen space within a
system of complex, constantly changing and shifting relationships.
Unlike the transparency effect which, as has been noted, works to
suppress the perception of mediation, the webpage offers the spectacle
of mediation at work. Against the immediacy-related principle of
transparency, there is the principle of *opacity*. While transparency
satisfies the user's need to experience the illusion of reality, opacity
appeals to the user's fascination with mediation processes and the
pleasure of seeing them in action.

> \[T\]he artist (or multimedia programmer or web designer) strives to
> make the viewer acknowledge the medium as a medium and to delight in
> that acknowledgement.[^02chapter1_40]

The webpage is a window that does not function as a metaphorical
threshold, like the screen in traditional cinema or television, which
once crossed admits the viewer into a reality beyond the screen. The
webpage is a window that opens only onto other windows, never onto a
three-dimensional reality that has or might have an independent
existence. Richard Lanham sums up the difference with a change of
preposition: *looking at* rather than *looking through.* Bolter and
Grusin put it this way:

> \[C\]ontemporary hypermediacy offers a heteregoneous space, in which
> representation is conceived of not as a window on to the world, but
> rather as 'windowed' itself – with windows that open on to other
> representations or other media. The logic of hypermediacy multiplies
> the signs of mediation and in this way tries to reproduce the rich
> sensorium of human experience.[^02chapter1_41]

The last remark foreshadows the major debates that have dominated
intermedial theory since 2005, revolving around the gradual abandonment
of the concept of medium in favor of mediation. In some artistic
practices, such as the theater, this move has been paralleled by the
shift from the representational paradigm to the presentational paradigm.
These concepts are developed by Tracy C. Davis and Thomas Postlewait in
connection with theatricality, the representational paradigm being
governed by mimetic logic while the presentational paradigm obeys the
logic of performance, in which one does not represent reality, but is in
it.

Bolter and Grusin's essay marks the high point of this first period of
intermedial theory, which we have called the mediatic period, and also
reveals its limits, to which we shall now turn.

## Postmediatic Intermediality: Remediation and Beyond

According to Alexander R. Galloway, the author of *The Interface
Effect*, '\[t\]he remediation argument \[...\] is so full of holes that
it is probably best to toss it wholesale'.[^02chapter1_42] It is a harsh judgment
but not without foundation: the remediation model is in fact seriously
flawed, both in its theoretical underpinnings and its ability to account
for the tremendous diversity of media interactions, which only increases
as we refine our observational tools. It quickly became apparent that
remediation, as conceived of and presented by Bolter and Grusin,
describes only one type of interaction and cannot be considered a
general scientific model of intermediality, as its originators suggest.
In a recent essay on intermedial dynamics, Lars Elleström uses the more
cautious terms 'media transformation' and 'transfer of media
characteristics among media' to better reflect the diversity which, he
notes, is observable in analyses of both the development of media (the
diachronic axis) and their modes of coexistence (the synchronic
axis).[^02chapter1_43]

We do not share Galloway's view that the remediation model should simply
be jettisoned. However, given its limitations, it does need to be
enriched and made more complex, for Bolter and Grusin confined
themselves to a fairly summary description of the mechanisms in play.
Taking our cue from Elleström, we also need to situate the model within
a broader framework, where it coexists with other types of media
interactions that must also be described. In this chapter, we will
discuss this expansion of the remediation model and look at some other
types of interactions. But first, we will discuss some of the weaknesses
that have been cited in the model's foundations, particularly the vein
of essentialism and questions of origin and precedence.

### Limitations of the Remediation Model

Intermediality rejects essentialist attempts to ascribe stable,
irreducible properties to media. The essentializing temptation appears
to us to be a remnant and legacy of the old debate over the paragon that
has marked thinking about the arts since the Renaissance and led to
their differentiation and hierarchization. The impulse to identify and
classify the mediatic dynamics crystallized in media likely derives in
large part from this paragonic reflex, triggered by the fact that the
first great mediations of the electrical age appeared in the
ontology-obsessed 19th and 20th centuries and possessed, or laid claim
to, an artistic dimension.

We have outlined how intermediality deals with dynamics that consist of
simultaneous movements of convergence, fragmentation, opposition,
fusion, retreat and advance that may be slow or abrupt, predictable or
chaotic. In this constant churn, nothing is fixed or assured. As we have
noted, while the remediation model is quite useful for clarifying
certain intermedial exchanges, its originators' attachment to the
(essentialist) concept of medium, inherited from classic communication
theory, limits its effectiveness and coherence. How can we reconcile
their resolutely dynamic definition of media – 'a medium is that which
remediates' – with traditional definitions that regard a medium as an
identifiable, stable entity with relatively clear contours, that
construct it as an object?

The origin figure is a key element in the essentialist arsenal, serving
as sanction and performing a legitimating or delegitimating function, as
the case may be. It is true that Bolter and Grusin's remediation model
partially evades it by excluding any first remediation – there was
therefore no original medium and their understanding of media is not
monistic – but nevertheless their model remains attached, as we have
seen, to the idea of precedence, through both the logic of the
'in-between' and the primacy they assign to the reproductive function of
media, returning us to the general principle of mimesis in which
remediation's central concepts of transparency and immediacy are
grounded. Mimesis postulates the priority of reality to replica, the
intelligible to the sensory, the immaterial to the material. It rests on
the idea of a source or model, an idea as vague as it is problematic.
But in both the priority of nature which inspires a work of art, and in
that of past works which have influenced an artist, there is a common
thread: the premise of precedence is colored by nostalgia. Curiously,
the essentially electrical modern media technologies that proliferated
from the 1880s, propelling their users into an unknown but promising
future, also played on feelings of nostalgia and evoked, implicitly or
explicitly, a return to paradise lost, the place where all was clear,
pure and true. Leaving aside the religious dimension of this yearning,
we will concentrate on its corollary, the trust in progress that
permeates Bolter and Grusin's essay and has left its imprint on the
thinking of the pioneers of intermediality as well as the media
industry's discourse since the invention of electricity. The belief in
progress makes nostalgia bearable, just as it nurtures it.

This attachment to the idea of progress explains why the first great
intermedial investigations, extending up to the dawn of the millennium,
dealt almost exclusively with 'successful remediations', i.e. with
remediations that led to the creation of successful 'new' media (all
electrical or digital, save a few exceptions such as the stethoscope,
the gramophone and the first phonographs). Emblematic examples include
records, cinema, radio, television and video. This focus stemmed from a
Darwinian conception of the evolution of media. As the media industry's
discourse suggests, media evolve just as living organisms do; we may
therefore assume that they move from success to success in accordance
with universal rules. Every step forward brings us closer to the
absolute medium, the medium that will one day be capable of mediating
everything with full transparency. We have already pointed to the
fundamental paradox here: in the future, technology, including media
technology, will make us still better off, as we were before. The
absolute medium that will make this possible is the mythical black box,
to which we shall return.

The optimistic, linear vision of media evolution that runs through
Bolter and Grusin's essay and infuses the mediatic period of
intermediality, which clearly rests on an old, essentialist substratum,
is, however, contradicted by reality. Greater 'fidelity' to the 'source'
– since media are replicating it with increasing accuracy – has been so
vaunted by the media industry for more than a century because it revives
the promise of a direct and true relationship to the external world.
Here we clearly see the simplistic nature of the remediation model. If
the obsessive quest for increased transparency – which often goes by
names such as fidelity, high fidelity, high definition, ultra-high
definition, stereo or surround sound – really were the sole driver of
remediation, how can we explain the fact that low-resolution mediations
like web documentaries shot with cellphones and MP3 tracks have not only
survived, but continue to thrive? How are we to explain the popularity
of grainy shots in cinema in an age of evermore powerful cameras?

While intermediality rejects essentialism, it also defies deterministic
thinking. Media transformations are not governed by a single,
predictable logic that is reducible to the idea of progress, as the
remediation model implies. Not every remediation process leads to the
emergence of a successful new medium. Remediation also creates losers,
failures, scraps, all that is not 'selected' by evolution. Attempts at
remediation can trigger unpredictable, chaotic reactions that do not
follow the straight path of progress. This less glamorous aspect of
remediation was largely ignored during the mediatic period of
intermediality. It was not until the 2000s that researchers undertook a
more thorough analysis of aborted remediation attempts and began
considering media that, unlike theater for example, did not survive
remediation(s) by cinema, radio or television, or survived in a weakened
state, losing influence and *mainstream* status. This essential aspect
of remediation, the survival of what Charles Acland has called 'residual
media',[^02chapter1_44] is entirely ignored by Bolter and Grusin. But the evidence
clearly suggests that cases of aborted remediation – remediation that
does not yield a new medium – are the rule, not the exception.

The essentialist temptation and the attachment to the idea of progress
are not the remediation model's only weaknesses. Though seductive, its
underlying tetrad – immediacy / transparency, hypermediacy / opacity –
is also problematic. As we have noted, for Bolter and Grusin,
remediation operates 'in the name of the real', which is to say its goal
is to produce the greatest possible transparency or, to use their
terminology, to create the best possible immediacy effect (in rendering
the object of representation). This first pair of the tetrad is opposed
to the second – hypermediacy /opacity – within a simplistic, dualistic
system that is presented as self-evident, when in fact the opposition is
in no way preordained. To be sure, the tetradic structure is not really
new: it derives from great debates in art history dating from the end of
the 19th century about the nature and function of art, and more
specifically the status of mimesis, a term of oft-noted polysemic
import: 'imitation, copy, tracing, transcription, translation,
execution, incarnation'.[^02chapter1_45] In an important essay entitled
*Transparence et opacité. Essai sur les fondements théoriques de l'art
moderne*,[^02chapter1_46] the art historian Philippe Junod, drawing heavily on the
work of the German philosopher Konrad Fiedler (1841-1895), shows how the
development of the machine in the 19th century paradoxically contributed
to 'a revalorization of manual labour',[^02chapter1_47] beginning with the work of
artists. Their previously little-studied *praxis* began attracting the
interest of analysts and of the artists themselves. The act of creation,
particularly painting, becomes a legitimate object of study and

> the ferment that accompanies the testing of new techniques enters
> theoretical consciousness and leads to the foregrounding of the
> *opacity* of the materials.[^02chapter1_48]

Later, Junod argues that opacity is what makes it possible to 'preserve
the perceptibility of artifice'.[^02chapter1_49]

> The theme of the value of artifice as a specific characteristic of
> art, which was picked up by romanticism and passed on to symbolism and
> then Russian formalism, was present throughout the \[19th\] century
> and its development led to the theories of *theatricality* \[...\],
> litterarity \[...\], pictoriality \[...\].[^02chapter1_50]

In other words, to specific forms of mediation and mediality. In his
demonstration, Junod aligns transparency with mimesis and opacity with
*poiesis.* While the first principle, says Junod, dominated artistic
practice for nearly two thousand years, the second is currently
displacing it and informs modern art, in which the work is independent
and functions autonomously, without transparency or referent, outside of
mimesis.

In Bolter and Grusin, Junod's equations

   transparency = mimesis, opacity = \* poiesis \*

are replaced by

   transparency = immediacy, opacity = hypermediacy.

These parallels should not surprise us; they betray the debt that the
creators of the remediation model owe to art history and aesthetics. Nor
is that influence new; it is evident in the first major works on
electrical media.

There are two possible charges against Bolter and Grusin: that they
hewed too closely to this model transplanted from another field, or not
closely enough. The idea of *poiesis*, inherited from Fiedler, is
dominated by the central principle of action and activity. Everything
happens in and through action; all flows from it. This eliminates any
precedence and, most importantly, makes performativity the basis of the
creative dynamic, for both creator and user. It is surprising that while
Bolter and Grusin note the existence of non-mimetic mediality,
particularly in their discussion of hypermediacy, they do not delve more
deeply into what is a vital dimension of intermediality. We shall return
to this point in Chapter 3.

In this specific case, Bolter and Grusin fail to apply the artistic
model strictly enough, but in others they would have done well to depart
from it. Junod himself enriches the model's complexity with, for
example, the concept of 'obscured transparency',[^02chapter1_51] which he uses to
account for works that proceed from mimetic logic but are ambiguous and
assume meaning only through the action of the spectator/user. What
Junod, and through him Fiedler, are stressing here is the sociomedial
side of all mediating practices, as much as their performative
dimension.

The absence of this consideration is acutely perceived in the passages
in which Bolter and Grusin attempt to articulate immediacy, transparency
and opacity. Either mediation is opaque, in which case there is no
immediacy, or it is imperceptible, in which case there *is* immediacy.
Aside from the fact that this is a simplistic alternative – as the
category of 'obscured transparency' demonstrates, reality is more
complex – Bolter and Grusin fail to take into account the user's agency
and capacity to change and adapt. In her study of the spread of the
telephone in the US, Carolyn Marvin traces its transition from
curiosity, in the technology's 'magical moment', to part of everyday
life as people assimilated its protocols, from learning how to
manipulate the device to adopting a telephone voice.[^02chapter1_52] This
'naturalization' of the device cannot be analyzed by simply wielding
concepts of opacity and transparency for the simple reason that, at the
end of the day, the device remains. We come to notice it less, or not at
all, but this does not mean that it has become transparent, and that
evolution does not produce the effect of immediacy. We therefore need to
revisit the basic equations that correlate opacity with hypermediality
and transparency with immediacy, and enrich the model with new elements,
such as the 'obscured transparency' category we have mentioned,
inopacity, and so forth, to make it truly operational.

### Enriching the Remediation Model: Media Resistance, Demediation Opacification

We have seen the breakthroughs achieved by intermedial research up to
the mid-2000s, and looked at resistance to remediation and the media
residues left by remediation. This is fertile ground. Studies of sound
in theater and still more recently of magic shows are examples of the
new research paths that continue to improve our understanding of an
intermedial reality composed of interlacings, intersections,
'entanglements', retreats and accidents, which the necessarily linear
genealogy of media that inspired the first intermedialists could not
readily account for.

Sibony linked the in-between to the origin, but also regarded it as a
locus of trials, and it is true that remediating processes sometimes,
though not always, produce reactions of varying degrees of violence
governed by a general principle that we call 'media resistance', which
may be understood as an attempt at counter-remediation. This too is
entirely absent within the scope of Bolter and Grusin's analysis. Media
resistance is a defence mechanism triggered when the basic elements of
the mediating conjuncture are, or more precisely appear to be,
jeopardized by the intrusion of an exogenous element. The resistance
mechanism can have the effect of preventing, avoiding or delaying the
introduction of the new element, or even expelling it after it has made
an incursion, in which case we can speak of 'de-remediation' or simply
'demediation'. The decline in the use of fixed sound systems in some
theaters with the advent of talking pictures is a striking example.
Analyses of technical specs and prompt books show that 'technologically
reproduced sound', which had made a widely noted and welcomed entrance
to the theater stage, was gradually evicted from it. And the evidence
clearly suggests that this expulsion was not related solely to the
waning of its drawing power (as a curiosity or novelty).

To be sure, there is no essentialism at work here. When a 'medium'
resists an incursion by a new technology (which is generally what the
newcomer is), it is not behaving like a living organism secreting
antibodies to expel or destroy an intruder. The resistance is always of
a sociomedial nature: it arises in the community of men and women in
which the medium operates; it springs from values; it is tied to a
discourse, to representations. The microphone, which was long rejected
by the theater – although today its use is becoming increasingly common,
so much so that it goes unnoticed – was readily accepted on the cabaret
stage for use by singers. And yet, since the days of Shakespeare,
theater reviews had been complaining that it was hard to hear the
actors. They did not articulate clearly enough or did not speak loudly
enough; the audience was too noisy; or the sounds emanating from the
stage or the building were too loud; or the acoustics were lousy. The
arrival of sound systems could have solved those problems and enhanced
theatrical mediation. But the theater resisted. Meanwhile, the cabaret
halls put in sound systems and pulled in the crowds.

Media resistance is governed by a two-sided logic: it is a reaction to
remediation, i.e. to the tendency of any media practice, artistic or
not, to incorporate into its mediating action knowledge, techniques,
technologies, values, behaviours and protocols that are foreign to it,
and at the same time it checks the tendency of those elements to invade
an established media practice. It must be said, however, that much less
resistance is mounted against content than against production processes,
as the rich tradition of adaptation (of novels for the stage, of plays
for the movies, etc.) shows.

Media resistance also points to the fact that remediation doesn't only
happen between media, it can also strike elements – again, often
technologies – that are not attached to any specific medium, as was seen
during the 'great digital conversion' of the late 20th century. Nor is
it a one-way process. What we can extract from this is that media are
not the only things that remediate or are remediated, and remediation
produces all manner of effects, including media resistance and
demediation (also illustrated, in a way, by the renewed popularity of
vinyl records and the preservation of 16 mm and 35 mm film).

One of those effects, a somewhat surprising one, relates to the question
of opacity. According to Bolter and Grusin, opacity exists when
mediation is perceptible to the user. But Bolter and Grusin never
consider the origins of opacity. Let us take the example of the use of
the microphone in the theater. For reasons we will discuss later, the
theater, like the opera, initially banned the mic from the stage, while
three major media practices – records, radio and talking pictures (to
which we might add cabaret) – developed and triumphed because of it. The
radio played a central role in this process. The radio microphone truly
revolutionized the art of public speaking, sparking an explosion of
vocal styles. With radio, says Jacob Smith, the audience discovered that
private speech and everyday conversation, could be elevated to the level
of public speech and reproduced as such (or at least so it was
perceived) on the radio in its infinite diversity, without exaggeration,
without the familiar stage effects, 'transparently'. It was the dawning
of the age of the crooner, the dulcet-toned singers who, instead of
making the back-row seats shudder, made hearts flutter. President-to-be
Franklin Delano Roosevelt saw the change and grasped the persuasive
power of the intimate new medium. He started his *fireside chats* In
1929, at the beginning of the Great Depression, and continued them until
1944, into his third term as president. In those radio addresses, he
talked to his fellow Americans about the great problems of the day in
conversational terms. Radio sounded true. And the audience could tell
the difference. The comparison with theater, another locus of public
speech, was inevitable. As a result, observes Smith, 'vocal conventions
of the histrionic stage were becoming all too audible as conventions to
many listeners'.[^02chapter1_53]

The new aurality created by radio brought out the artificiality of the
voice and diction of stage actors, which had always been based on
projection, volume and eloquence. Those fundamental qualities had been
so assimilated by users that they no longer noticed them. They had
become 'naturalized'. Until the end of the 19th century, i.e. the advent
of sound reproduction technologies, a fine voice was necessarily a
powerful voice. The theater decided to stick with that. The contrast
with radio voices laid bare the incongruity of theatrical practices,
which used the pretext of 'truth', meaning unmediated, supposedly
'natural' relationships between actors and spectators, to celebrate an
unnatural way of speaking.

Understood in terms of the logic of remediation, this development made
opaque an aspect of mediation that had previously been naturalized (the
mediation having become partially or totally transparent). This process
is called 'opacification'. In our example, one medium, radio, rendered
the mediation effected by another, theater, opaque. Thus, contrary to
what Bolter and Grusin suggest, opacity does not spring solely from a
medium's bid to assert its identity or from a developmental dynamic, but
can arise from a conjuncture on which it may have no purchase. When
opacification is not produced by the medium itself, it is almost always
hostile to the medium and damages its image.

The mechanisms of media resistance, demediation and opacification do not
exhaust the possibilities for further development of the remediation
model, but the model's scope still remains limited, and it is clear
today that this product of an age obsessed with recycling – industrial,
esthetic, cultural, philosophical – cannot by itself account for the
complexity and diversity of the intermedial dynamic. Other types of
media interactions have been uncovered recently. In the following
section, we look at the concepts of hypermediality, convergence and
transmediality, which for the past 10 years have been at the center of
intermedial reflection.

### Hypermediality, Convergence and Transmediality: Other Models of Intermedial Dynamics

The concept of hypermediality emerged in the field of theater studies in
the mid-2000s. From the intermedial point of view, theater is, of
course, a medium. Indeed, it is the quintessential intermedial practice
insofar as it is itself made up of interacting media – music, set
design, plastic arts, dance, gesture, the actor's performance, the
script, etc. – just as a webpage is composed of interacting elements. To
put it in Bernd Herzogenrath's terms, theater is an *intermedium*, in
Jens Schröter's terminology, it is a *super medium*. Chiel Kattenbelt
goes still further, arguing that theater is a hypermedium but in a
rather different sense than what Ted Nelson means by the term, as the
following passage makes clear:

> \[F\]ilm, television and digital video are technology-based media that
> can record and play back everything that is visible and audible,
> within their specific ranges of sensitivity, but they cannot
> incorporate other media without transforming them under the conditions
> of the specificity of their own mediality. At the very most, media can
> *remediate* (Bolter and Grusin 1999) other media, which implies in the
> end a refashioning. Clearly, theatre is not a medium in the way that
> film, television and digital video are media. However, although
> theatre cannot record in the same way as the other media, just as it
> can incorporate the other arts, so it can incorporate all media into
> its performance space. It is in this capacity that I regard theatre as
> a hypermedium.[^02chapter1_54]

A 'hypermedium' must therefore be understood as a federating medium, not
an assimilating or transformative one. It is an 'archi-medium' or
'medium of media', *home to all*, an interart, a technological meeting
place 'where the art forms of theater, opera and dance meet, interact
and integrate with the media of cinema, television, video and the new
technologies'.[^02chapter1_55] This welcoming attitude is reflected in the
theater's singular treatment of other mediatic objects, technologies,
arts and media that enter into the process of theatrical creation or
performance. The concept of hypermediality clearly derives from Bolter
and Grusin's concept of hypermediacy, but it goes further. One
attractive feature is that it eliminates the question of representation
– and the relationship to reality – for, to return to Lanham's 'window'
metaphor, it does not require us to choose between 'looking at' and
'looking through'. Better still, it allows for both simultaneously,
which fits well with current theatrical practices and the performative,
experiential approach. The concept of hypermediality not only enables
Kattenbelt to underscore the singularity of theater compared with many
other media, but also advances intermedial theory by revealing the
existence of systems of mediatic and technological interactions that do
not fall within the purview of Bolter and Grusin's remediating logic and
do not partake in its cannibalistic violence.

In 2006, the same year that Chiel Kattenbelt developed the concept of
hypermediality, Henry Jenkins tackled a central notion in the genealogy
of media, one that underpins the concept of remediation: media
convergence. It is not a new idea; its famous first appearance was in
Wagner's call for a *Gesamtkunstwerk* – a total artwork – but it truly
and lastingly took hold with the spread of electrical media in the first
three decades of the 20th century. The advent of talking pictures is one
of its most famous and memorable exempla, and also the most compelling
argument in favor of the existence of a convergence dynamic. The talkies
were in fact the result of the long-predicted 'convergence' of sound and
image reproduction technologies, which until then had developed
separately. Paradoxically, the forward-looking logic of convergence that
Jenkins attacks has a kinship with the nostalgic quest for an imagined,
pre-technological origin that has been shattered and whose fragments, to
use Sibony's image, must be pieced together again. That convergence is
supposedly driven by three main factors: continuous progress in the
relevant technologies; technological determinism, which tends towards
their fusion; and users' obsessive quest for absolute transparency. The
convergence principle, which is held to be operative in all media
dynamics, purportedly works 'in the name of the real', as the series of
industry slogans we have already listed – fidelity, high fidelity,
stereo, high definition, 3D, ultra-high definition, and so forth –
assert. The relentless drumbeat of these claims over the space of more
than a century constitutes a series of milestones – since they form a
sequence – on the triumphant road that will ultimately lead to the
absolute medium and perfectly transparent mediation, in Bolter and
Grusin's sense. 'Sooner or later, the argument goes, all media content
is going to flow through a single black box into our living rooms (or,
in the mobile scenario, through black boxes we carry around with us
everywhere we go)'.[^02chapter1_56] Media convergence, then, is posited as the
ultimate form of remediation, 'total remediation'.

Unlike Kattenbelt's hypermedia, which is federative and preserves the
mediality of each medium, the black box is integrative, mixing and
blending all that enters into it. The idea of convergence is so
widespread and so frequently invoked by the industry that it seems
natural and inevitable, but Jenkins demurs. In his view, technological
progress cannot be separated from the conjuncture in which it arose and
technological determinism is an illusion, a marketing ploy: 'convergence
refers to a process, not an endpoint'.[^02chapter1_57] Jenkins argues that
'\[p\]art of what makes the black box concept a fallacy is that it
reduces media change to technological change and strips aside the
cultural levels'.[^02chapter1_58] But '\[c\]onvergence does not occur through media
appliances, however sophisticated they may become. Convergence occurs
within the brains of individual consumers and through their social
interactions with others'.[^02chapter1_59]

One of Jenkins' great merits is that he has refocused intermedial
reflection on the key role of the user (he uses the word 'consumer') and
more generally on the ever-changing environment from which media emerge
and in which they operate. He thereby converts the traditional concept
of media convergence – spontaneously understood as 'technological'
convergence – into a theory of comprehensive convergence,

> where old and new media collide, where grassroots and corporate media
> intersect, where the power of the media producer and the power of the
> media consumer interact in unpredictable ways.[^02chapter1_60]

How then can we subscribe to any kind of teleology? The answer is
simple: the black box is a myth created out of whole cloth by the media
industry to justify planned obsolescence and its ever-faster product
replacement cycle. But the current participatory culture, which is tied
to the shift to performativity and embraces networking and collective
intelligence, has other demands: users do not want, if they ever did, a
'one-size-fits-all relationship to media content. Consumers want the
media they want, where they want it, when they want it and in whatever
format they want'.[^02chapter1_61] Media convergence supposedly led towards a
single super-medium, the black box; this new participatory culture,
which according to Jenkins is creating a 'convergence culture', leads in
the opposite direction, towards media divergence. To adapt to new user
behaviours, the industry needs to multiply its platforms, specialize
them for specific purposes, and find ways to circulate its media content
on them. This new dynamic set the stage for a decisive phase in
intermedial thinking: the birth of the concept of transmediality, which
illuminates intermedial relationships quite different from Bolter and
Grusin's remediation or Kattenbelt's hypermediality.

In the third chapter of his essay on the *Matrix phenomenon*, Jenkins
shows that even as the industry continued celebrating steady progress
towards the 'black box', it submitted to the logic of divergence by
creating 'transmedial' media content, i.e. content that can be adapted
to the various existing media technologies. *The Matrix* spawned three
feature films, a 90-minute television series, animated films, multiple
comic books, video games, etc.

Transmediality takes infinitely variegated forms, ranging from simply
distributing purportedly uniform content on different platforms, which
was the usual practice at the outset, to creating fragmented collective
intelligence, whose different parts are supported by different
technologies and the whole, like Paolo Soleri's arcology,[^02chapter1_62] cannot be
grasped from any vantage point.

In the first case, the objective is to adapt media content to different
medialities (or media) with the intention of preserving the content in
its entirety as far as possible. This conception of transmediality rests
on two major assumptions: that media content can exist independently of
mediation processes and, conversely, that those processes have no
content.

In the second case, the semantic content is broken up according to the
mediating qualities of the available platforms and the 'fragments' are
distributed across the platforms. Thus, to return to the *Matrix*
example, the user discovers new media content on each platform, since
each supports an aspect of *The Matrix* that corresponds to its specific
mediality. In practical terms, this means that no single user can master
the entirety of the media content; only the sum of users has that grasp,
and this relates to what is called collective intelligence.

There are some major issues here. Picking up on Jenkins' discussion,
Mark J.P. Wolf analyzes the impact of transmediality on traditional
distinctions between real and mediatized worlds.

> Transmediality implies a kind of independence of its object: the more
> media windows we experience a world through, the less reliant that
> world is on the peculiarities of any one medium for its existence.
> Thus, transmediality also suggests the potential for the continuance
> of a world in multiple instances and registers; and the more we see
> and hear of a transmedial world, the greater is the illusion of
> ontological weight that it has, and experiencing the world becomes
> more like the mediated experience of the Primary World.[^02chapter1_63]

While transmediality does not totally blur the dividing line between
what Wolf, referencing Tolkien, calls the primary world and the
mediatized world, it makes the distinction superfluous; from the point
of view of a transmedial logic in which user experience is paramount,
the question of representation becomes moot, as does the interplay
between immediacy and hypermediacy. As in the case of convergence, the
emphasis is on the user and the user experience, which is always real.
We have moved from the representational paradigm to the experiential
paradigm.

### Shattering the Medium: The Advent of Postmediatic Intermediality

Transmediality has had another notable impact on intermedial theory: it
challenges the very existence of media as they were conceived of by the
first intermedialists. In his definition of the medium, Véron did not
content himself with underlining the technological dimension; he made
technology the foundational element of a medium: 'a constellation
composed of a technology *PLUS* the social practices of production and
appropriation of that technology'. The 'double birth' model that André
Gaudreault and Philippe Marion extract from their observations on the
origins of cinema rests on this same principle of primacy. According to
Gaudreault and Marion, the double birth of a medium unfolds in three
phases: the appearance of a new technology (phase 1), the creation of a
device (phase 2), and the realization of the medium's expressive
autonomy and specificity, with all that this implies in terms of both
socialities and the medium's institutional dimension (phase 3). François
Odin describes the same process, calling the emerging technology a
'cryptomedium' (since it cannot yet be predicted that it will give birth
to a medium), phase 2 being the appearance of a 'protomedium', and phase
3 the appearance of the medium as such.

Transmediality doesn't just disrupt this chronology; it denies the
primacy of technology. Jenkins' critique of convergence culture, his
defence of media divergence, and all that this implies for transmedial
dynamics support the conclusion that a change in technology does not
produce a change in medium. This also has consequences for the origins
of media, as Jenkins makes clear:

> \[H\]istory teaches us that old media never die – and they don't even
> necessarily fade away. What dies are simply the tools we use to access
> media content – the 8-Track, the Beta tape.[^02chapter1_64]

Jenkins ends up drawing a clear distinction between the medium and what
he calls the 'delivery technology' for media content. 'Recorded sound is
the medium. Cds, MP3 files, and 8-track cassettes are delivery
technologies'.[^02chapter1_65]

Lars Elleström's work in recent years on multimodality moves in the same
direction. He divides a medium into three subcategories: the basic
medium, the qualified medium, to which artistic practices are attached,
and the technical medium, which corresponds to Jenkins' 'delivery
technologies'.

> Basic and qualified media are abstract categories that help us
> understand how media types are formed by very different sorts of
> qualities, whereas technical media are the very tangible devices
> needed to materialize instances of media types.[^02chapter1_66]

We can see at once the ontological and methodological issues presented
by this conceptual move and the concomitant risk of a reversion to an
essentialist vision of media. To date, a medium's identity has been
defined primarily by the material dimension of the mediation, but what
happens if an important element of the mediation – Elleström's technical
medium or Jenkins' delivery technology – is radically changed? Will this
lead to the end of the medium? That is precisely the question at the
center of Gaudreault and Marion's essay, *The End of Cinema? A Medium in
Crisis in the Digital Age*. They ask whether 'cinema, in its shift to
the digital, has simply made a turn (in which case we could speak of a
digital turn) or whether it is in the process of becoming something else
– whether it is undergoing a true mutation (in which case we could speak
of a digital mutation)'.[^02chapter1_67] The latter case will presumably need a new
name. The authors quote, in passing, Raymond Bellour to the effect that
'digital technology is not enough to kill cinema. Although it may
disturb it in many respects, it does not touch its essence'[^02chapter1_68] and
draw on the genealogy of cinema arguing that the movies are not dying;
it is just that 'a generation stands aside and makes room for the
next'.[^02chapter1_69]

The genealogical argument is attractive. To the double birth model they
developed in 2000, the second birth being the institutionalization of
the medium, Gaudreault and Marion add a third birth, which is currently
in progress: 'an integrative and intermedial birth involving a degree of
return to porosity, to a hodgepodge, to hybridity, to crossfertilization
- all of which imbued the medium's very first birth'.[^02chapter1_70] By comparing
the current state of affairs with an older period in the history of the
medium, Gaudreault and Marion endow it with ontological legitimacy:
digital is mediatically acceptable since the change it produces echoes a
situation that is already inscribed in the history of the medium. They
accredit the rupture thesis defended by Jenkins and Elleström: even a
media practice as technologized as cinema can survive the most radical
technological transformations.

Current intermedial thinking, i.e. that of the postmediatic period, is
characterized by the erosion of belief in determinism and progress – and
particularly the death of the illusion of mediating exclusivity – as
much as it is by the shattering of the traditional conception of media
and the demise of technological primacy. The question of a medium's
identity has become secondary to its action and its position in
transmedial configurations. Not only do we now know that the set of
characteristics once used to define a medium is in fact unstable and in
constant flux, but we have also understood that no characteristic is the
exclusive property of any one medium and none, taken in isolation, is
decisive for the medium's survival, not even an array such as the
camera-projector-screen triad that appears so essential and basic.

The conclusion to which Gaudreault and Marion come doesn't just confirm
Jenkins and Elleström's hypothesis about delivery technologies, since
this applies to all components of media; it spells the end of the
traditional conception of a medium as summarized by Véron. Hence
Alexander R. Galloway's dictum: '**not media but mediation**'.[^02chapter1_71] For
Galloway, any attempt to find or impose a clear and stable definition of
media is not only vain, but a pipe dream we must shake off, along with
the technocentric thinking behind it. In a shift that reflects the
ascendancy of the performative perspective in the field of media
studies, mediation is now granted priority.

As Müller observes, intermedial thinking was born of a radical
rejection, a break with the understanding of a medium as a 'monad'
operating independently and analyzable in isolation. Proceeding from
Marshall McLuhan's idea that every medium includes another medium,
Müller and the first intermedialists showed that a medium is always in
interaction with other media. They called this interactive dynamic
'intermediality'. They soon came to the realization that intermediality
came first; it is intermediality that produces media. Revolutionary
though it was, this first period of intermedial thinking remained
focused on the concept of medium until the mid-2000s. Hence our label
'mediatic intermediality' for the first phase of intermedial thinking,
which spanned the 20-year period from 1985 to 2005.

The difficulty of defining what a medium is, and the basic technological
mutations that have made it impossible to confidently associate a medium
with a given technology or technologies, have led researchers in
intermediality to abandon the historical concept of medium in favor of
the idea of mediation, or what we call 'mediating conjunctures'. Thus,
over the past 10 years, we have gradually entered the postmediatic phase
of intermediality.

# Essence and Performativity

## Introduction

In Chapter 1, we described the history of intermedial thinking as a
gradual transition from a theory of media, constructed as objects, to a
theory of the end of media – a 'postmediatic' theory. This development
was accompanied by a steady decline in essentialist ways of thinking
about media. Intermediality can therefore be said to have sprung from
the shift from an essentialist heuristic (based on the assumed existence
of competing media) towards a non-essentialist heuristic (there are no
media but rather dynamic convergences that produce forms of mediation,
what we call 'mediating conjunctures' – see Chapter 3). We therefore
divide intermedial thinking into two periods: the mediatic and the
postmediatic.

We believe this important development calls for further analysis for two
reasons. First, because it is a paradigm shift that cannot be understood
as a linear progression, as a teleologically ordained advance from a
flawed theory to a better one. In fact, both the essentialist and
non-essentialist paradigms run through the history of Western thought.
Indeed, the debate between their proponents may be considered a pivotal
theme in the history of philosophy since its inception. Secondly, while
essentialist thinking poses serious problems for our apprehension of the
world, a radically and exclusively non-essentialist approach may land us
in different, but equally insurmountable, theoretical pitfalls.

We might put it this way: the need to avoid reducing media practices to
reiterations of actions that were predetermined by a medium's
specificity calls for postmediatic thinking, but can we escape the need
to characterize media practices and understand the specific features by
which they are distinguished? In short, while the complex concept of
'medium', as understood prior to the postmediatic period, exposes the
difficulties of a radically essentialist stance, its critique brings us
up against the limitations of any non-essentialist position. If we try
to define one medium's characteristics in order to distinguish it from
another – to articulate the difference between a printed book and an
e-book, for example, or between a play and a movie that tell the same
story – we take medium and content to be mutually independent (the
position defended by Jenkins[^03chapter2_1] and Elleström[^03chapter2_2] ), which confronts us
with the paradox of imagining content without a medium, ready to be
shaped in one manner or another, depending on the chosen medium. If, on
the other hand, we take the non-essentialist view and suppose that
content and medium are inseparable, how then can we identify the
characteristic features of a given medium, or even discuss them? How can
we contemplate the very existence of media specificities? The
non-essentialist perspective could logically lead to a sweeping
conflation of media practices. In this case, ontological interrogations
must be set aside, for media constellations do exist, if not in reality
at least discursively. It would be naïve to think that non-essentialism
could simply displace and replace essentialism.

Given the limitations of both positions, we will begin by expanding our
critical analysis of essentialism from a philosophical perspective,
drawing on the concept of performativity. In chapters 3 and 4, we will
look at how the essentialist / non-essentialist contradiction can be
transcended in order to escape the opposed perils of conflation and
static categorization.

## Essence and Flux: The Irreducibility of Movement

The history of Western philosophy starts with the apparently
irresolvable aporia produced by the opposition between the one and the
many. The first philosophers picked one side or the other, defending
either the unity of reality or its plurality. Most of the questions that
have claimed the attention of philosophers in the West and beyond arise
from this opposition. Briefly put, unity is the notion that makes the
ideas of essence and concept possible, whereas multiplicity grounds the
possibility of motion and freedom. This debate remains pertinent to this
day and the theoretical issues it throws up will inform our reflections
on media.

In Book 1 of the *Metaphysics*, Aristotle discusses the ideas of
Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic School, who held that reality is
one. As Aristotle notes, the difficulty with this position is how to
account for motion, since Parmenides is 'compelled to accord with
phenomena'.[^03chapter2_3] As we observe the world, we see that it is in motion,
that things mutate and change, that they do not abide in immobile
oneness. The Eleatics maintained that observation of phenomena was
deceptive: in reality, there is no motion and things do stay as they
are. In his famous paradoxes,[^03chapter2_4] Parmenides' pupil Zeno tries to
illustrate the logical absurdities that ensue from the idea of motion
and its incompatibility with reason. Motion is irrational. In the
paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, Zeno imagines Achilles racing a
tortoise. Achilles, the much swifter runner, gives the tortoise a
10-metre head start. The race begins and Achilles quickly covers the
first 10 metres. But in the meantime, the tortoise has also advanced a
few centimetres. So it is still ahead. It will take Achilles only an
instant to cover those centimetres, but in that time the tortoise will
have moved a miniscule distance, which will still separate it from
Achilles. Ultimately, Achilles will never be able to overtake the
tortoise. From this line of reasoning, Zeno deduces that motion is an
illusion: we inhabit a shifting world of appearances but in truth, all
is immobile, for motion is a contradiction.

Other philosophers, of course, defend a diametrically opposed position:
Heraclitus sides with motion and arrives at the conclusion that there is
no unity or essence, only flux: 'No man ever steps in the same river
twice',[^03chapter2_5] for everything is in movement, 'everything flows'.

The opposition between the one and the many is central to the dialogue
Plato entitled the *Parmenides*, believed to be one of his last. It has
been read as self-criticism, for Plato seems to be concerned with flaws
in the essentialist view of the world, the very approach he had embraced
with his theory of forms.

Plato poses a simple question: how can we move from one point to
another? In other words, how are we to explain change?[^03chapter2_6] The
difficulty resides in the fact that any essentialist theory rests on the
principle of non-contradiction. Nothing can have two contradictory
properties: it is not possible for a thing (A) to have a property (+p)
and not have it (-p). This principle is sometimes bracketed with the
'identity principle': the proposition that we cannot say a thing
possesses an attribute and its opposite (p and not p) is the equivalent
of saying that it is what it is.

Non-contradiction is therefore also the logical principle that allows us
to ascribe a stable identity to a thing, to establish its essence. For a
thing to have an essence, it must have certain properties and not their
opposites. For example, according to the principle of non-contradiction,
a chair cannot be white and, at the same time, not white. If we paint it
blue, a change has occurred. The first chair is no more, and we now have
a different chair. This is not a problem if we consider the two chairs,
white and blue, separately. The difficulty arises when we try to
establish a relationship between them. How do we get from the white
chair to the blue one? What is in between the two? We would have to be
able to speak of a chair that is white and not white, or blue and not
blue.

This is exactly the paradoxical question that Plato asks in the
*Parmenides*: how can we get from stasis to motion? Untangling the
problem rationally poses daunting challenges: at a given point in time
(T), there is a motionless object; at another (T~1~), an object in
motion. How can we account for this change? As can be seen, this is the
same conundrum as the problem of the chair. First (T) there is a white
chair; then (T~1~) a blue chair. To progress from time T to time T~1~,
we must imagine a transition between the two, a paradoxical instant in
which the thing is in motion and not in motion, or the chair is white
and not white. In that instant, the principle of non-contradiction does
not apply.

Plato calls this paradoxical transition by the Greek word
*exaiphnes*,[^03chapter2_7] which means, precisely, 'instant'. The *exaiphnes* is
an in-between, an inter-space where opposites coexist; it might
therefore be translated as 'interval'. Plato's discussion of the concept
is highly complex and has been the subject of diverse interpretations
for centuries. These may be organized into two opposed camps:[^03chapter2_8] the
*exaiphnes*, as the in-between, is either the locus of contradiction or
a non-locus where mediation is effected. If the *exaiphnes* is a locus,
it is a conflicted space, a place where opposites coexist, the tragic
scene of a contradiction. This conception of the in-between is precisely
what Sibony picks up on,[^03chapter2_9] as we have seen. From this view, the
*exaiphnes* is the site where the white chair and blue chair coexist.
But the *exaiphnes* can also be conceived as a non-locus, something that
escapes space and time, a void, an abyss. In the first interpretation,
the *exaiphnes* is the instant in which a thing at once possesses a
property and does not, in which the chair is white and not white. In the
second, it is the mysterious nowhere in which the thing has neither one
property nor the other, the chair is neither white nor not white.

The defining features of intermedial thinking are readily discernable in
this logical structure: on the one hand, the attempt (typical of
intermediality's mediatic period) to situate the in-between as the site
where two or more media coexist; on the other, the jettisoning of the
concept of medium in favor of media practices, proceeding from the
concept of mediation. But in either interpretation, the *exaiphnes*
poses serious problems for our attempts to rationally account for what
we see. It is difficult to wrap our minds around any challenge to the
principle of non-contradiction, for our thinking and language are
predicated upon it. We shall return to this question in Chapter 4, where
we examine processes of naturalization.

## Discrete, Continuous, Digital

Our analysis of the philosophical premises underpinning the distinction
between the mediatic and postmediatic periods in intermedial thinking
can be taken one step further: the opposition between essence and motion
can be correlated with another, more formal antithesis between discrete
and continuous. As shall be seen, these two categories also ground the
distinction between analog and digital, which is critically important in
current discourses about media.

The discrete and the continuous are two opposed forms of representation
of reality. The mathematical difficulty of rendering them commensurable
is, in a sense, at the root of the paradoxes we have described. To
define these two terms, which in general physics correspond to the
distinction between particle and wave, it may be said that an object is
discrete when it consists of a set of (finite or infinite) unitary,
indivisible parts. Whole numbers are discrete: there is nothing between
1 and 2; the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are each unitary, indivisible elements.
Similarly, a fruit basket is a set of discrete parts, for it consists of
a series of indivisible units, each single fruit. By contrast, a
continuous object is not made up of parts but is always further
divisible, and its distinguishing property is density: between point A
and point B there is always an infinite series of points. Real numbers
are continuous. Water is continuous. One cannot have one water or two
waters; it is a dense body.

The difficulty of understanding the transition from stasis to motion,
and the paradoxes that attend interpretations of change in general,
derive from the impossibility of explaining the continuity of reality
starting from a series of discrete units. To return to our chair
example, the observation that there was a white chair and then a blue
chair clearly hinges on a discretization of reality: we isolate two
objects and posit them as whole, unitary, indivisible parts of reality.
White chair (1), blue chair (2). When we try to understand what happens
between points 1 and 2, we are forced to shift from the discrete to the
continuous, and this raises a number of difficulties, beginning with a
mathematical dilemma.

The problem is that our language is inherently discrete (consisting of
words, phonemes, etc.) while reality appears continuous. The attempt to
understand the objects of perception using our discretizing apparatus is
troubled by paradoxes, the resolution of which can be counted among
humanity's loftiest aspirations. It might be said that all scientific
thought – and technical thinking in particular – strives to refine our
apparatus for discretizing reality in order to grasp the world as a
continuous system without eliding its complexity.

Digital may be seen as the most recent and potent expression of this
endeavour, which can be traced through the history of science from the
Greeks to Leibniz to contemporary sampling theory. In its primary
meaning, 'digital' refers to the recording of sounds and images (or
other information) as discrete data points, as opposed to the continuous
recording mode used by analog. Analog recording reproduces phenomena in
a way that is analogous to reality, that is, continuous. The sound curve
inscribed on a vinyl record is continuous; if we take any two points on
it, we will always find an infinite number of points between them. The
curve is therefore 'dense' in the mathematical sense of the word. By
contrast, the digital principle breaks the continuity of sound into
discrete parts. This discretization process is what is called
'sampling'. In practical terms, it consists in taking a continuous sound
wave and selecting sample points from it. This method doesn't capture
the sound as a whole but rather the changes between set intervals. A
shorter interval will yield more precise sampling and therefore digital
sound of higher quality. However, the sound has an inherently lower
grade than that produced by analog recording, since it does not reflect
the continuity of the original, but only a number – albeit a high number
in many cases – of sample points. The discretization process simplifies
the recorded sound by reducing it to a series of whole numbers,
specifically 0's and 1's. This simplification makes the reproductions
easier to manipulate.

To sum up, it can be said that analog is more 'faithful' to reality, for
it is continuous, but it is very difficult to transport, transmit,
archive, describe and manipulate, while digital is less 'faithful' since
it is discrete but easier to work with. Ironically, the industry
supported the move from analog to digital on the grounds that it would
improve sound quality, repeating the logic of the original argument
about fidelity and high-fidelity discussed in Chapter 1. This disconnect
between discourse and reality is indicative of the complex, non-linear
relationship between tools, practices and discourses that underpins
sociomedialities, the constantly shifting civil groupings produced by
social dynamics.

However, analysis of the digital / analog duality clarifies the main
advantage of discretization. While it doesn't provide a 'faithful'
representation of reality, it does yield a better purchase on reality, a
way to master it, understand it, manage it. Discretization is the basis
of technical thinking: if we want to have a working knowledge of the
world, knowledge that enables us to act on reality, we must divide it
into discrete parts.

## Media and Action

We will now try to apply these formal principles to the question of
media and mediation. The discrete / continuous opposition provides
another angle from which we may attempt to chart a middle course between
the radically essentialist and radically non-essentialist positions. On
the one hand, it is not possible to reduce the continuity of reality to
a series of distinct, immobile units, which in our case would mean
reducing media practices to stable media. On the other hand, we need to
be able to articulate a (discretizing) discourse about them. How can we
do so without identifying them, without marking their boundaries?

As we have seen, the concept of medium carries a heavy essentialist
burden: the in-between is understood as a solid, a thing. In this case,
media are objects; each medium – radio, television, the Web – has its
own specificity. The essentialist approach renders shifting
configurations discrete and graspable, but it thereby runs the risk of
reifying them and suppresses a critical factor: action.

Defined in formal terms, an action is anything that can be expressed by
a verb (other than a stative verb). An action can be of many sorts:
loving, thinking, suffering, moving, feeling, and so forth. So an action
exists where there is movement, a process. It is what occurs within the
continuity and flow of reality. The idea of an in-between that serves as
a passage between two discrete units therefore runs counter to the
conception of action as a continuous movement that cannot be reduced to
two poles. The irreducibility of action renders it incompatible with
discretization. This is precisely what Zeno's paradoxes demonstrate:
within the confines of a reality mapped as a series of discrete points,
action is impossible. Achilles will never be able to overtake the
tortoise. In an unconditionally essentialist frame of reference such as
Zeno's, there is no room for verbs, with the sole exception of the verb
'to be'. The postmediatic approach therefore spurns the concept of
medium in favor of mediation, a move that enables it to restore the
centrality of action. This is the argument Alexander Galloway makes in
his essay *The Interface Effect*, to which we shall return.[^03chapter2_10]

In a way, the first intermedialists' efforts to understand the human and
non-human mechanisms and agents, at work in the complexes they called
media, served precisely to define media on the basis of stable,
recognizable features, and therefore to essentialize them by focusing on
their elements rather than on what they do, *i.e.* the process of
mediation. This useful and indeed necessary fragmentation for the
purposes of observation led the early intermedialists to define three
structures of mediation, which they believed could be used to pin down
the specificity of each medium: the *support*,[^03chapter2_11] the interface and
the apparatus. One medium could be distinguished from another by the
particular type of mediation it performs. It was believed that this
approach would make it possible to delineate the specific
characteristics of media practices. In other words, by looking at the
*support*, the interface or the apparatus, they would be able to grasp
the specificity of the 'theatrical apparatus' in relation to the
'cinematic apparatus', or of a 'digital interface' compared with another
interface, or of print as a *support* compared with a computer monitor.
These three categories effectively encompass the normative dimension of
media – that is, they articulate how a specific medium structures,
shapes and determines an action. (As we shall see, these processes can
also be described using Grusin's concept of premediation, or the idea of
'affordance' advanced by Donald Norman.[^03chapter2_12]) The categories of
*support*, interface and apparatus therefore perform a key function in
differentiating media practices and grounding their identities. But, at
the same time, they confront us with a series of aporias and paradoxes
that cannot be ignored. After briefly defining the three terms, we will
attempt to show why their use is problematic.

## *Support*

Let us begin with the concept of *support*, a term with multiple
meanings that pervades French discourse about media despite its
polysemic character. Etymologically, it refers to something that is
under something else and holds it up. It is a base that structures the
thing it bears. This primary meaning can be illustrated by the holder or
trellis that supports a plant, or by the verb 'to support' in the sense
of providing physical or moral succour.[^03chapter2_13] One can rest on a *support*
or rest something on it. But when we look at a plant holder, we see that
it isn't just a base on which a plant stands. A *support* is more than a
foundation or a pedestal. Unlike a foundation, it structures and shapes
the thing it holds up. A plant holder is the object on which the plant
stands, to be sure, but it can also mould a plant, making it grow
straight or at the desired angle.

We must begin by asking what it is the *support* holds up.
Theoretically, it could be anything – a plant, a person, or (and this is
what interests us) an idea, content or information. To speak of a
*support* means there must be a thing that can be imagined – or at least
named – that existed before it was supported. First there is a plant,
and then, if it is placed against a trellis, it will grow as the trellis
bends it; it will assume a given shape. First there are people, and
providing them with support will help them live more fulfilling lives or
at least ease their pain. First there are ideas, and the *support* helps
them take form, materialize. This point bears repeating: speaking of a
*support* presupposes the prior existence of the thing that will be
supported. This idea is implicit in the term 'content': content is
something that exists separately from the *support* that holds it.

Secondly, we need to ask how the *support* structures the thing it
supports. The answers may vary. Its structuring effect may be great or
small. For example, a mature tree may be supported by a post to keep it
from bending beneath the wind. Without the support, the tree would
nonetheless continue to grow, perhaps at a slant, and it would remain
more or less the same tree. In the case of water, the *support* has far
greater structuring power: without a container, water has no form and
cannot be grasped, isolated or identified. Water takes the shape of its
container.

A *support* for ideas, content and information can be said to operate in
much the same way. Content (data, ideas, information, etc.) can be
considered independent and self-sufficient to varying degrees, depending
on one's point of view. The role of the *support* is to receive it and
structure it. Content may be likened to the tree – the *support* only
keeps it from growing warped – or on the contrary to water, which is
completely shaped by the *support*. In either case, the conceptual
structure is the same. On one side, there is the content; on the other,
the *support* which structures it and which *is* the medium, in a sense.
For example, a printed book can be considered the *support* for writing;
the book is what holds the writing and partially structures it. The same
text could be conveyed in another form, such as parchment or a monitor.
The various *supports* are therefore understood as different ways of
mediating between the writing and its reception. First came the writing,
and then the document in the form in which we are reading it. The
document changes form depending on the *support*. A different *support*,
a different medium produces a different mediation. Clearly, the extent
of the difference will depend on the structuring power we ascribe to the
*support*. In writing like the tree – the difference between reading it
in print or on a monitor is not huge, or more like water – the
difference is pronounced since water can assume any shape.

This is precisely the idea McLuhan critiques in *Understanding Media*.
The media theoretician showed that a medium cannot be separated from its
content. The understanding of *support* and content outlined above
raises two conundrums: what would writing without a *support* look like,
and what would the *support* be if it bore no writing? There is no easy
answer to this two-pronged question. We can readily imagine a bottle
without water, but what about a book without writing or writing that is
inscribed on nothing? This takes us to the heart of the debate about
media that has followed from McLuhan's analysis. If a medium establishes
a mediation between two things, it becomes difficult if not impossible
to separately identify those two things.

Bruno Bachimont considers digital a *support*. He observes that things
that exist in non-digital form (such as books, videocassettes, photos)
can be transferred to the digital realm, calling this migration
'recontextualisation'.[^03chapter2_14] The *support*, then, is the context in which
the content appears. According to this logic, there is always a
*support*. There is no writing or video without a *support*; they have
only moved from one to another. But still, how is it possible to speak
of transferring content from one *support* to another unless we are able
to bracket the *support* and focus on the content? In other words, if we
say we are transferring a video from cassette to digital, we assume the
video exists apart from its holder. Or, we must assume that the holder
itself has been transformed, which amounts to saying that the mediation
is a mediation of a mediation, as McLuhan suggests when he says that the
content of a medium is always another medium: the book contains the
writing, which contains text, which contains language, and so on *ad
infinitum*. In practical terms, it amounts to essentializing mediation,
to making the mediation process itself an object, a substance, more than
a *support*. Ultimately, this substance – whether it is a book, a screen
or a cassette – supports only itself. Can we still call this substance a
medium if the things it mediates no longer exist?

These considerations suggest that the very idea of *support* is
problematic for intermedial discourse: Bolter and Grusin's concept of
remediation already underscored this difficulty, and McLuhan elucidated
the impossibility of the unmediated object, for mediation is always a
mediation of something. Therefore, the medium does not produce a
mediation but rather a remediation. In line with this logic, a *support*
can only hold another *support* and can never truly support content.

## Interface

The concept of interface reproduces the same theoretical structure. The
prefix 'inter-' also refers to an in-between, in this case to the
interstice between user and machine, or between a graphical platform and
a code. If the *support* is the mediation between the pure idea and the
idea incarnate, the interface is the mediation between inside and
outside, the transition zone.

But, as Alexander Galloway shows, the window metaphor often used to
describe the interface cannot fully account for its role and
function.[^03chapter2_15] While a window frames a relationship between two spaces,
it does not explain what happens in passing from one to the other. The
interface is an in-between that effects a transition between two sites
and is in this sense a mediation. Where the concept of *support* posits
the existence of a thing that takes a different form than it initially
had because of the in-between constituted by the *support*, the concept
of interface offers the possibility of transforming content in an
intermediate space in order to adapt it for a different space. The
transition zone between inside and outside is the place where content is
transformed to make it intelligible on the other side of the threshold.
To bring inside and outside face to face, there must be a link, like the
lens in eyeglasses, that serves as the 'inter-face'.

A simple example is the interface that renders code usable by human
beings. To take an everyday instance, a webpage is text marked up in
html (hypertext markup language). An html tag is not intuitively
interpreted by human beings: the code's 'inside' must be transformed by
mediation to make it usable on the 'outside' by the viewer. To do so, a
software application, in this case a browser, serves as the interface
and transforms the code into the graphically organized page that users
see on the screen. We therefore have two poles – the code and the page
displayed – and an in-between – the interface – which mediates between
the two and enables the passage from one to the other.

This example raises a series of problems as soon as we endeavour to
analyze it more closely. First, the identification of the two poles is
dubious. As we saw with the *support*, when we go looking for the
'original content' we quickly realize there is no content that isn't
already a product of mediation. In the case of html, the code plainly
results from interpretation of another code, which transforms a series
of 0's and 1's into alphanumeric characters through the process called
character encoding. The computer cannot generate text directly; it can
do so only through a mediation – an interface – between text and
numbers, based on a defined character set (such as UTF-8).

We therefore arrive at other content, the series of 1's and 0's. But
this content is also the product of a mediation: the numbers must be
converted into a series of electrical signals (on = 1, off = 0). And the
electrical signals must in turn be interfaced with the circuitry, and so
on *ad infinitum*. So we're back to the structure of mediation described
by McLuhan, and the concept of interface loses its meaning once we
realize that anything can be defined as an interface: any point may be
read as a threshold, as a passage between one thing and another. That is
precisely the structure we described when we looked at the concept of
hypermediacy. So the question is not so much whether there is a passage
or whether we are in it but rather what specific effects the mediation
produces in a given situation. In other words, we must consider whether
the mediation determines the content in question, and if so, how.

## Apparatus

The concept of apparatus[^03chapter2_16] is more helpful than the other two notions
we have discussed in understanding how a mediation produces something.
The central question relates to what occurs in the instant of mediation.
How does the moment of mediation determine the meaning and structure of
the thing that is mediated? For example, how does printing a book
determine its content? Or how does publishing an article on the Web
determine its meaning, reliability and substance?

Grusin uses the principle of 'premediation'[^03chapter2_17] to analyze the force of
predetermination in mediation. The structural organization of television
illustrates the workings of premediation: the frame is set in advance;
the time allocated to each specific type of content, to commercials and
to the entire palimpsest is predefined. This framework has a decisive
effect on everything we see on the screen.

'Affordance', particularly as Donald Norman defines it in his work on
design, is a variety of predetermination that formally parallels
premediation. Affordance is what a tool suggests by its shape and
structure. Every technical object carries within itself a
predetermination of the action it will set in motion: a chair invites
the user to sit on it, a doorknob to turn it, a button to press it.

These principles of predetermination are inscribed in the notion of the
apparatus, a complicated concept that demands clarification. To begin
with Foucault's definition, an apparatus is 'a resolutely heterogeneous
body composed of discourses, institutions, architectural arrangements,
regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific
statements, philosophical propositions, morals, philanthropy – in short,
both the said and the unsaid.'[^03chapter2_18] This understanding of apparatus,
which can be compared with the concept of institution developed and
popularized by Pierre Bourdieu, is a central term for Foucault. Giorgio
Agamben provides a three-point synthetic definition, based on Foucault:

a.  An apparatus is a heterogeneous set that includes virtually
    > > anything, linguistic and nonlinguistic, under the same heading:
    > > discourses, institutions, buildings, laws, police measures,
    > > philosophical propositions, and so on. The apparatus itself is
    > > the network that is established between these elements.

b.  The apparatus always has a concrete strategic function and is always
    > > located in a power relation.

c.  As such, it appears at the intersection of power relations and
    > > relations of knowledge.[^03chapter2_19]

This definition recalls Éliséo Véron's definition of a medium, cited
above.[^03chapter2_20] The apparatus is the network that binds together this
heterogeneous constellation and it performs an organizing function. It
is a set of discursive and technical elements that determines actions
and behaviours. The apparatus structures the realm of possibility. For
example, a classroom is an apparatus. A heterogeneous array of factors –
the architecture, the arrangement of tables and chairs, the school's
authority, the teacher's role, the subject matter's place in the
curriculum and in the collective imagination, etc. – shapes what
transpires in the classroom, namely the course. Each apparatus has its
specific affordance and premediation: a classroom designed as a lecture
hall will prompt the teacher to deliver lectures and inhibit the
functioning of any other type of activity, such as a workshop.

Bruno Bachimont stresses the determinative and even prescriptive power
of the apparatus, which he describes as a 'physical and spatial
organization capable of producing and determining a process. The essence
of the apparatus is that its spatial configuration determines temporal
behaviour.'[^03chapter2_21] In other words, the apparatus transforms space into
time. The combustion engine illustrates the process: it is a 'physical
and spatial structure organized to produce a temporal cycle.'[^03chapter2_22] The
same applies to the classroom: the arrangement of the room and the set
of spoken and unspoken rules that define its meaning and function
produce and delimit the actions that can be performed within its walls.
In Bachimont's terms, the classroom is an apparatus because it is a
space that produces time and action of the course.

The apparatus, then, is what produces a mediation; it might be said that
it is located between the intention and the completed action. For
example, let us imagine an academic class; the apparatus 'course' is
located between the course imagined by the teacher and the course she
delivers is the classroom, which determines and structures her actions.
Indeed, it is impossible to conceive of a course without the space in
which it is conducted, for the space establishes the 'course format'.
Clearly, the space is not created *ex nihilo*; as it is part of a larger
complex – the institution, its protocols, its history, power
relationships, expectations, and so forth – that endow it with its
structuring power. It may therefore be concluded that the apparatus
determines behaviours and actions.

Proceeding from the concepts of *support*, interface and apparatus, we
can now attempt to tease out the meanings of the word mediation. We will
distinguish among four types: formal, communicative, phenomenological
and teleological.

In a purely formal sense, any process that links two things can be
called a mediation. This is the type of mediation we find in the notion
of the *exaiphnes*. The transition from point A to point B presupposes a
linkage between them, and that link is a mediation. The advantage of
this definition is that it posits mediation as a fundamental structure
of our connection to the world. The relationship between stasis and
motion, discrete and continuous, content and container can all be
conceived in terms of mediation. The problem with this definition is its
breadth; there is nothing that is not mediation. It is therefore too
all-encompassing to be useful as an operational definition for a theory
of media.

From the standpoint of communication theory, mediation may be defined in
Claude Shannon's terms, as the process by which a message is transmitted
from a sender to a receiver. This model is particularly well suited to
analyzing the semiotics of media practices; that is, for investigating
the production and circulation of meaning via different types of media.
A book carries the meaning of its content and conveys it to readers. One
limitation of the communication approach is that it does not lend itself
to analysis of forms that do not seem to involve the transmission of
meaning, and yet clearly qualify as media practices in our view.[^03chapter2_23]
For example, most Web activities serve instrumental ends more than
communicative purposes and are not readily reducible to an exchange of
messages. When we buy a book online, we are not having a conversation
with someone, but rather manipulating objects, just as if we had made
the purchase in a bookshop. To be sure, the online transaction, or the
bookstore purchase for that matter, can be considered a form of
communication, but that amounts to saying that everything is
communication, much as everything is mediation in the formal sense
discussed above. We find ourselves up against the same problem of
generalization.

A third possibility is to ascribe a more phenomenological meaning to
mediation and regard it as the condition of possibility for perception.
This approach was already suggested by Aristotle in *On the Soul* and
has been picked up more recently by intermedialists such as Lars
Elleström. To summarize, mediation is the process that makes perceptible
to the mind something that would not otherwise be so. This definition
has the merit of being wide enough to embrace a series of media
practices without necessarily leading us back to communication theory.
The problem is its anthropocentric – or, at the very least, anthropo-
and zoo-centric – bias. The rise of information technology forces us to
question this limitation, for the digital arena is occupied in large
part by machine-to-machine interactions that have nothing to do with
perception. Can those interactions be excluded from the realm of
mediation? Another difficulty with this approach is the existence of
practices – the magic show being the most salient example – in which the
effect of the mediation is to make imperceptible what would otherwise
have been perceptible.

Lastly, there is a teleological conception of mediation: mediation is
what makes it possible to reach an end. It is the tool used to perform
an action, the hammer that drives in the nail. This is the dominant idea
behind our discussion of *support*, interface and apparatus: mediation
is what enables and structures the action. This approach is compelling
but comes with its own flaws: it emphasizes that mediation is a
determinant of action, which is certainly true, but neglects the fact
that the instant of action is subject to an element of indetermination
as well. The concept of performativity offers us a theoretical handle on
that indetermination.

## Performativity in Intermediality

Postmediatic intermedial thinking dismisses essentialist arguments and
foregrounds necessarily situational processes of convergence. From this
point of view, there are no media; there are only dynamics – or, in
Dworkin's terms, media are not things, but rather activities.[^03chapter2_24]
Reality is no longer apprehended as a series of immobile objects endowed
with an essence, but as motion itself. There are no things, only
movement; no essence, only action; no media, only convergences that
produce mediations.

Clearly, this is not a recent opinion; as we have seen, it was first
propounded by Heraclitus, the philosopher of flux and motion. Not only
is this point of view not new but neither is it confined to philosophy.
Nietzsche's critique of ontological thinking invites a number of
arguments that have informed not only intermedial thinking, but a wide
swath of contemporary research in the humanities, most notably in gender
studies. For example, Judith Butler's questioning of traditional
conceptions of sexual identity in *Gender Trouble* has some bearing on
our own field inquiry:

> The challenge for rethinking gender categories outside of the
> metaphysics of substance will have to consider the relevance of
> Nietzsche's claim \[...\] that 'there is no "being" behind doing,
> effecting, becoming; the "doer" is merely a fiction added to the deed
> – the deed is everything'. \[...\] \[W\]e might state as a corollary:
> There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that
> identity is performatively constituted by the very 'expressions' that
> are said to be its results.[^03chapter2_25]

From this point of view, the poles between which the in-between
supposedly lies are only a *post hoc* projection, constructed after the
event. There is no white chair or blue chair but only a motion, a
process. Our language needs to discretize the continuity of the process
and hence describe it after the fact by postulating that there was a
white chair and then a blue chair. The two chairs are freeze frames,
abstract crystallizations of a continuous movement that resemble the
sampling of the aforementioned sound waves. In reality, there is only
the process. The instant in which the motion occurs is inhabited by a
force, a tension that cannot be essentialized. It isn't a 'thing' or a
space.

Clearly, it isn't easy to describe this motion using our language, with
its heavy essentialist burden; our words are also essentializations.
Plato's *exaiphnes* can be interpreted as an instant that eludes the
discretized timeline along which essences are strung. To describe the
same theoretical structure, Nietzsche used the term *das Tun*, Bergson
*élan*, Derrida *différance*.

If we bring this perspective to bear on our analysis of technology and
media, then the interface can no longer be understood as the point of
passage between two things. The interface becomes the only reality: the
two poles are produced retrospectively by the interface. Therefore,
mediation cannot be conceived as a negotiation between two ontologically
pre-existing poles, for those poles appear only belatedly, subsequent to
the action which actually occurs in the interface.

As we know, the word 'media' is often used to essentialize mediation and
frame it as a point of passage between two pre-existing poles. Rejecting
the previous poles leads us to conclude, in agreement with postmediatic
thinkers such as Galloway and Dworkin, that there is no such thing as
media; there are only practices. In this case, there is no longer an
in-between for there is nothing for it to be between. There is nothing
but action transpiring in the continuum of reality. It is only in
meeting the requirements of language that we crystallize actions by
freezing and naming them retrospectively. The naming of media – radio,
television, the Web, theater – is an example of this process. We shall
return to this point in Chapter 4.

As we have argued, assigning priority to action and refusing the
traditional concept of media probably constitutes the key shift in
intermedial studies in recent years and marks the transition from the
mediatic to the postmediatic phase. To sum up the logic of the
postmediatic approach, we might paraphrase Judith Butler by replacing
'gender' with 'media' in the passage we have quoted: 'There is no medium
behind the performance; media are performatively constituted by the very
expressions that are said to be their results'.

The concept of 'performativity' – which focuses our attention on the
action, on what is happening in the here and now, and links it to its
conditions of possibility – proceeds from the same logic as the concept
of media convergence that we defend here. The conditions from which it
emerged, the tensions from which it sprang and which it has spawned, are
akin to those that gave rise to both phases of intermedial thinking, and
can similarly be traced back to the Platonic intuition of the
*exaiphnes*.

## Performativity as a Component of Action

While the concept of performativity originally emerged in philosophy of
language, it bears relevance well beyond language, especially in the
field of theater. Performance studies have contributed to some of the
more promising theoretical developments of our day, as François Cusset
observes in *French Theory*.[^03chapter2_26] Cusset argues that the American
reception of the thinkers broadly referred to as 'structuralists' and
'poststructuralists' (notably Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Barthes)
sparked tremendous theoretical vitality in the United States while
stalling the debate in the French-speaking world. In the postscript to
the book's second edition, Cusset notes that the arrival of performance
studies in France at the end of the 2000s ushered in a renewal of
theoretical debate in the French-speaking world and is now driving an
international surge of new theoretical discussion. Performance studies
can therefore be regarded as one of the mainsprings of contemporary
theoretical reflection.

The concepts of performance and performativity[^03chapter2_27] are increasingly
gaining traction across fields of theoretical analysis: in theater,
literature, philosophy and political science. However, clear definitions
that would enable us to distinguish between the two and pin down their
respective meaning sometimes appear to be lacking. We will attempt to
elucidate such definitions here.

More specifically, we will look at what we have called 'action' and
examine the relationship between action and performativity. Every action
is determined to a greater or lesser degree. Depending on our analysis,
some actions may appear wholly determined, others entirely free. We have
discussed the concepts of premediation and affordance, and considered
how the types of determination they imply influence media devices. We
will now turn to the structure of action to seek the non-determined
element, the component of action that permits a margin of freedom. We
will call that element 'performativity', but we assign a more precise
meaning to the term than what we find in Austin or in performance
studies. To understand how mediation can be considered performative, we
must first develop a theoretical analysis of performativity as a
component of action, and define the difference between performativity
and performance.

In this discussion, it must be borne in mind that the determined and
non-determined elements of action cannot be separated in reality. This
is a discursive distinction that serves an epistemological function,
clarifying our understanding of the structure of action, and is not
rooted in any ontological divide.

## Drama and Performance

We will begin our dissection of action by returning to the theater and
demonstrating that action on stage illustrates more generally the
action's structure. Action in the theater presents us with an evident
paradox. On the one hand, we can think of it as the quintessential form
of action: overt, visible, public. At the same time, it appears fake and
fictional, which is why the word 'theatrical' has taken on a negative
connotation. What do actors do? According to one interpretation of
dramatic action, an actor does everything but act, in the sense of
performing an action. This is a striking contradiction: the word actor,
which specifically denotes the subject's relationship to action and
doing, also refers to an essentially passive function. Actors do not
act: they don't love, or kill, or die on the stage. Actors don't do
anything because everything has already been determined: the action on
the stage is not an original but a reproduction, a sham. It is a feigned
and deceptive 'liveness'. Theatricality, then, is a fiction, a form of
mimesis; it designates representation as opposed to presentation.

Another aspect of traditional drama is the degree to which the actors'
actions are determined. Everything is often decided in advance. Drama
consists in recreating, on the stage, something that has or could have
already occurred. The action happened in the past and is only evoked,
recalled, imitated in the theater. The script crystallizes and
standardizes the action. A flawless drama, then, is one in which nothing
happens: it is a perfect reproduction, a replica that is
indistinguishable from the original and, precisely for that reason,
entirely false.

Performance lies at the other end of the spectrum: there are no actors
in a performance precisely because there is action. The performer isn't
reproducing anything: she acts, she drinks, she eats, she loves, she
moves and she suffers.

But this opposition, which underpinned the abandonment of theatricality
in the theater in the 1980s and 1990s in favor of performativity, cannot
withstand scrutiny. The question of the determination or indetermination
of action is more complex and irreducible to any binary pair. The true
polarity – though strictly speaking it is no such thing, at least not in
the conventional sense of polarity – must be sought elsewhere, in the
opposition between the determination and performativity of action. Those
two elements, which coexist to varying degrees in any action, define
what happens on the stage as drama or performance. All theater is
partially determined, from the most faithful rendition of a script to
the most improvised performance.

What is true on the stage applies to all action. The dramatic model
calls for particularly standardized action, while the performative model
leaves more room for indetermination. But in every case, on or off the
stage, our actions contain an element of determination, which we shall
now consider in greater detail. That element of determination has
multiple and varied aspects, but we will confine ourselves to three that
we believe to be of particular importance: the spatial frame, the
symbolic context and the physical constraints. These factors all fit
into the framework that Grusin calls premediation.

When a stage is used for a play, a playground for a baseball game, a
classroom for a course or a bedroom for a nap, the spatial and
architectural environment limits and structures the action. The
architecture, understood in its broadest sense as the organization of
space, functions as an apparatus; it predetermines – and premediates –
the spectrum of possibilities. A chair predetermines the act of sitting
down, a door the act of opening and closing, and so forth. 'Natural'
spaces, necessarily perceived through a cultural lens, are also endowed
with this power of predetermination, lending them an architectural
dimension. A lake beckons us to swim in summer or skate in winter.

The second determinant is the symbolic context of the action. In the
case of the theater, it is what was written, put in place or more
generally planned prior to the drama or the performance, *i.e.* the
script. Outside the theater, the symbolic context may also be a 'script'
that structures and determines actions. That script consists of all the
texts that make up the social and cultural framework: mores, traditions,
the social apparatus.

Lastly, there is a series of mundane logical and physical necessities:
physiological requirements, physical forces and limitations, logical
principles (it cannot be raining and not raining at the same time).

These three factors, to which we shall return in the next chapter,
determine and circumscribe the action. From a strongly deterministic
point of view – such as the one implicit in the concept of apparatus as
defined by Bachimont – no non-determined space remains: if we knew all
the constraints, we would be able to predict every action. Spinoza's
*Ethics* provides a well-known example of this claim; for Spinoza, an
action is the result of all the constraints by which it is produced.
There is therefore a strict causal relationship between the preceding
situation and the ensuing action.

## The Temporal Structure of Action

Determinism can take various forms: physical (such as Laplacian
determinism, which holds that if we knew all the physical variables in
play at time T, we could predict the state of the world at time
T1),[^03chapter2_28] logical (Diodorus Cronus's master argument, according to
which, based simply on the principle of non-contradiction, we can
establish which propositions are true and which are false at any given
moment, and therefore into the future),[^03chapter2_29] or fatalistic (there is a
predetermined ending, like the script of a play).

All these varieties of determinism are rooted in a specific
interpretation of the time sequence in which the action is embedded.
They assume linear time, consisting in a series of discrete units from
which particular moments, linked by the principle of causality – a
string of cause-effect relationships – can be picked out. In other
words, the deterministic conception of action is entrenched in an
essentialist understanding of reality: there is a 'before' – the script
– and an 'after' – the playing out of the script. We therefore return to
the two poles discussed earlier, and the essentialist perspective
postulating that they are ontological precedents to the in-between that
connects them.

Ontologically, then, the essence of the 'before' – the script – and the
'after' – the performance – must already be given, prior to any action.
To stage a drama, there must already be a script and an idea of what it
would and should look like when performed on the stage. From an
ontological point of view, the two poles have priority over the action
on the stage that runs counter to our conception of the chronology of
action.

Approaching the question from a chronological angle, Paul Ricoeur
describes a sequence of mimetic action consisting of an original, a
mediation, and then a copy. There is an initial pole (the original) and
it is from the mediation – the in-between – that the second (the 'copy',
or the representation) springs. But while there is a shift in
perspective between the ontological and chronological points of view,
they spring from the same essentialist conception of the order of
things. Both rest on the discretization of reality and agree on the
primacy of objects.

These two foundation blocks are the nub of the problem. By positing the
existence of two poles, the essentialist approach forces us to attach
the action to one of them, specifically the second, the one that comes
chronologically after the first. The action is understood as the simple
effect of a determining cause. Applied to the theater, this logic casts
the performance – determined by that which preceded it and is its cause,
namely the script – as the action.

But how can we conceive of the script as a separate, pre-existing
entity? Contrary to Barthes, recent work in dramaturgy by Joseph Danan
convincingly shows that the script also fully participates in
theatricality; it already bears within itself the conditions of its
performance. In a way, it is a product of the performance because, to
enlist Grusin's concept once again, it is 'premediated'.

If removing the script from the creative dynamic to which it belongs
served only to reify a gesture, the consequences would be relatively
limited. But the attempt to fragment a flow, to oppose action and
object, to separate the inseparable, which is characteristic of the
essentialist approach, has more dire effects. Those consequences urge a
non-essentialist position which holds that script and performance can be
discussed only from the standpoint of action: there is no object outside
the action, and for there to be an object, there must be an action. For
there to be a script, there must be the action of writing, or reading,
or playing.

Returning to the example of the chair, there aren't two chairs and
something that connects them. There is only an action, the act of
painting a chair blue. It is the only reality. The two chairs, white and
blue, are discursive constructs. They are a response to the action of
painting, a *post hoc* mental configuration. Similarly, it could be said
that in the theater the action is not the performance of a script but
what happens on the stage, from which script and performance emerge to
form a dynamic, indivisible whole.

Clearly, the non-essentialist approach poses a major challenge, for the
real, continuous instant in which the action occurs is ungraspable and
undefinable. It remains mysterious and escapes all the varieties of
determinism implied by essentialist thinking. It is in this instant – in
the *exaiphnes* – that the performativity of each action is to be found.

We propose to further develop this perspective and frame a different,
non-essentialist, non-deterministic conception of action and hence of
mediation. To do so, we must first define the difference between
'performance' and 'performativity', which are often confused.
Performance is an artistic rendering while performativity is a property
of action. Any action is, to some degree, performative.

## The Undecided

Performativity is the element of each action that eludes determination.
It is what happens in the instant of action that could not have been
foreseen. Let's return to the example of traditional drama, which would
appear to be the least performative variety of action, since everything
seems to have been planned in advance (barring an element of
improvisation). The actors recite the text without changing a word. They
have rehearsed it many times to find the best delivery, and just the
right intonation, for each line. Their movements were blocked
beforehand. And yet, in the moment when they are on stage, acting,
something happens that transcends the predictable. A singular tension is
created precisely because what happens on the stage is happening
*there*, and no amount of rehearsal can strip that moment of a margin of
unpredictability. There is always a gap between what was determined and
what occurs in the *exaiphnes* of the action. It is in this sense that
an actor acts. All was decided and yet an undecided slice remains. That
space is precisely the locus of performativity, for the undecided
element is what remains to be determined, what remains open,
unpredictable.

There are therefore two distinct but complementary ways to view an
action. From an essentialist position that conceives of reality as
discrete, we may focus on what predetermines an action, or we can try to
understand it as part of the flow of reality, as that which fills the
*exaiphnes* and always remains undecided.

Clearly, both positions are tenable. It cannot be denied that every
action is determined and, at the same time, retains a margin of
indecision. But viewing action from the standpoint of performativity is,
first and foremost, an ethical and political imperative. Those twin
demands prompt us to redefine our terms. From a theoretical point of
view, we may choose the approach that suits us best and focus on
analyzing the determinants of action to understand its causes, if choose
to. From a political point of view, we need to seek the performative
element of action because that is where we will find the zone of freedom
and responsibility. We cannot be responsible for something that has
already been determined, but only for what is as yet undecided, where
our actions can sway the outcome. Responsibility prevails in the
*exaiphnes*: only in the non-determined space where I enjoy a margin of
freedom can I be accountable.

From the ethical point of view, the key question is: precisely what
remains undecided? The ethical approach probes the performative aspect
of an action to delineate the zone of freedom in which responsibility is
possible. If we are not responsible for what has already happened, for
what is finished and immutable, but only for what can still be done
differently, then performativity is the condition of possibility for
ethical choice.

Viewed through a political lens, all norms and apparatus of power are
determinants of action. But an action can have no political significance
if it is entirely controlled by those norms and apparatus: it assumes
political meaning when it seeks the empty space, the zone of indecision
that allows for creative normativity. Performativity disturbs norms
because it overflows from their determinative power and produces
something new, unexpected and therefore, to some degree, subversive.

These ethical and political considerations are the rationale behind the
narrower sense we assign to the term performativity. First, it is
important to detach performativity from performance as an artistic
practice, although the two are historically linked, and to distinguish
between the two meanings of 'performative', wherein one is bound up with
performativity and the other with performance. In common parlance,
performativity and performative relate to the general idea of action in
progress, of that which is being done. Indeed, 'performativity' and
'action' are often used interchangeably. This very broad usage is
problematic. While every action has a performative dimension, the
performative is not coextensive with action. In our definition,
performativity denotes only the undecided component of action, which is
also its normative component, in the sense that instead of perpetuating
existing norms, it produces new ones.

By thus distinguishing action from performativity, we can avoid the
debate about the determination and indetermination of performativity
that Judith Butler sums up in *Excitable Speech*.[^03chapter2_30] She outlines the
limits of the approach that originated with J.L. Austin's *How To Do
Things With Words*,[^03chapter2_31] a seminal text in the development of
performance studies. For Austin, utterances are performative when they
'do' an action that has been predetermined by the situation in which
they occur. The sentence 'I pronounce you husband and wife' is
performative because it creates a marriage, in accordance with the
pre-existing codes and conventions that determine what a marriage is and
how it is contracted.

Butler argues that the performative can, on the contrary, produce
something novel, something that transcends and challenges the situation
in which it occurs. But this does not mean the situation imposes no
limits. For Butler, there is an interplay between situational
determination and norm-creation in the performative.

We agree that action has a dual nature, but we will use the term
'performative' to refer only to its non-determined side. As we have
argued, the line between the two components can be drawn only
discursively, for the performative and the determined cannot be sundered
in reality. Nevertheless, we must consider them separately if, for
ethical or political reasons, we wish to examine the undecided element
of action.

## Mediation as Performativity

What does this perspective mean for mediation? We have seen the
essentialist and non-essentialist interpretations of the term. From a
non-essentialist point of view, mediation is a way to understand the
*exaiphnes* as an instant that belongs to neither the before, nor the
after. Mediation is what happens in the moment: it is the creative
instant of action. In this sense, it is pure performativity.

From an essentialist point of view, mediation can be described as
something between two moments, two objects, and so forth. There is a
moment A and a moment B; and mediation is the path from one to the
other. Thus, as we have discussed, mediation is itself essentialized and
reduced to a determined, pre-established apparatus. In the process, the
indecision that inhabits the moment of mediation is lost.

Let us take an interface as an example. It can be described in two
opposing ways. From the determinist / essentialist point of view, it is
what lies between code and user. The code and the user were already
there, determined and well-defined. The interface links them but is
wholly determined by the nature of the two things it connects. The code
is already written, the user is already in front of the screen with
expectations, abilities and needs. From the characteristics of code and
user, we can deduce the interface. Its function is pre-established: what
happens in the mediation reproduces what was already plotted. Similarly,
the essentialization of the interface compels us to conceive the action
that occurs within it as entirely determined – by its premediation, by
its affordance, by the fact that it is an apparatus, in Bachimont's
sense.

If our interest is in the undecided element, we must frame the picture
differently. Mediation becomes the starting point of the analysis, for
it is all we have. In the *exaiphnes*, there is neither user nor code,
but only the interface. The user and the code are produced by the
interface: they make their appearance only because there is an interface
that connects them. All that seemed to be decided and determined is in
fact open: the mediation is located in the undecided zone and is
therefore performative. Or, more precisely, the mediation contains
premediated and undecided aspects that are ontologically inseparable,
but we must consider them separately in order to distinguish the element
of freedom in every action.

This approach is particularly pertinent to the analysis of digital
practices, as shall be seen in the final chapter. Much of the discussion
around information technologies has centered on their normative
dimension, how algorithms and technical devices premediate action to the
point of transforming users into automatons.[^03chapter2_32] But while focusing on
the predetermined aspect of technological practices illuminates a basic
feature of their operation, it is politically perilous, as it forecloses
responsibility and gives rise to a discourse imbued with paternalism. It
is true that any use of a platform is premediated by its structure, but
there are also emancipatory possibilities insofar as our behaviours can
etch new norms for that platform. We are conditioned, to be sure, but we
also condition at the same time. We may be exploited, but that
exploitation bears within itself the potential for normative agency.

In the following chapter, we explore this idea and illustrate the
relationship between mediation and performativity, which we will attempt
to elucidate using the concept of mediating conjunctures.

# Mediating Conjunctures

## Between Multiplicity and Identification

The idea of mediating conjunctures began with an observation: the terms
used in the field of media studies are problematic because either they
relate to an essentialized vision of mediation phenomena, or else they
are vague in that they have no operational value. In the previous
chapter, we defined the difficulties created by notions of *support*,
interface and device. And yet the most problematic notion is the term
'medium' itself.

We have shown that this term is tied to the intermedial phase that we
have named 'mediatic'. This notion, as well as its associated terms,
falls under an essentialist vision of mediation phenomena. This is why,
based on the postmediatic phase, researchers such as Galloway propose
that we simply abandon the concept of medium and concentrate on
mediation. We are likewise convinced of this necessity, but we believe
that we should also specify what the mediation process refers to.

One of the founding hypotheses of this book is to think that there is no
initial element that will thereafter be 'mediated': there is nothing
that comes before mediation. Bolter and Grusin apply the same principle:
there is nothing prior to the act of mediation. This initial aspect of
mediation implies that we cannot think the real as a layering of
mediations.

But this approach has a limit, as it provides a definition of mediation
that is simultaneously too vague and too particular. Too vague because
it ignores both the production methods relating to the mediating
operation and the moment that it is produced; too precise because it
presupposes that there would only be one operation, implying that it is,
generally, a singular process: we refer to mediation and not mediations.
And yet, if we were to concentrate on what is produced at the time of
each action, what occurs appears a little more complex. There is no
mediator; there is instead an ensemble of elements in play at the time
of the action and these elements (forces, human and non-human agents,
contextual aspects...) intersect, merge, oppose, meet and double in a
continual movement. It is this desire to move away from mediation as an
objectifiable and singular process that leads us to resist the idea of
'medium' that refers to prefabricated mediation forms that are already
structured and identifiable.

In the instant of the action, if we observe the interplay of these
elements, we can identify particular conjunctures. These conjunctures
are moving combinations that form the elements in play at the time of
the action. This is what we call 'mediating conjunctures'.

The notion of mediating conjunctures allows us to find a median path
between essentialism and non-essentialism, and therefore to not reduce
mediatic practices to defined and pre-defined units, but to otherwise
consider them as moving dynamics, without abandoning the possibility of
identifying the specific characteristics of these practices. In
completing Galloway's definition by which there is no media, but only
mediation, we can say that, in reality, there is no mediation that is
singular and identifiable, but mediating conjunctures.

Mediating conjunctures are necessarily plural. They are the moving
contexts – and thereby irreducible to *one* context – of action, the
dynamic configurations that an ensemble of interplaying forces and
agents in a determined space adopt at the moment of action. These
mediating conjunctures are what make the action possible, but they are
at the same time what produce it. This paradox warrants clarification:
on the one hand, mediating conjunctures are the environment where the
action takes place, they are what in part condition and shape it; on the
other hand, they can only be formed because the mediating dynamic has
already been set off.

The concept of stigmergy, that we borrow from Ollivier Dyens,[^04chapter3_1]
appears particularly useful for explaining this singular logic.
Originating in the field of biology, stigmergy describes a form of
self-organization. It is based on a simple principle: that a trace left
by an action in a given environment stimulates the completion of a
subsequent action in the same environment, regardless of whether this
new action is accomplished by the same agent or a different agent. The
movement of schooling fish offers a good example of stigmergy. The
school's shape is the outcome of all of the fish's movement but, at the
same time, it is also the cause: each fish's movement is determined by
the shape of the school. In other terms, the notion of stigmergy allows
us to think about the premediated aspect of each action and its
performative dimension. If we could take into account the ensemble of
perspectives from which the school of fish is observable, we would have
an exhaustive account of mediating conjunctures present in one precise
moment. This is, however, practically impossible and we must, as often
as possible, concentrate on the most precise elements. For example, we
could disregard everything surrounding the schooling fish and limit
ourselves to trying to understand the mediating conjunctures that are
related to its internal dynamics. But we could also widen our point of
view and identify another mediating conjuncture that would include, for
example, a shark in the vicinity of the school, whose action would
obviously influence the shape of the school and the behaviour of the
fish. We could also observe the ensemble of dynamics in play in the sea
or land area, or even concentrate on the simple interaction between the
fish involved in the school. It is clear that these possibilities are
infinite and that each is legitimate: it is therefore the plurality of
these points of view that determines the plurality of mediating
conjunctures. One particular mediating conjuncture is a discursive
abstraction, made as a result of one particular perspective.

The notion of mediating conjunctures allows us to avoid the pitfall of
conceiving of mediation as an exclusively homogenous device determining,
structuring and producing the action. In other terms, the idea of
mediating conjunctures allows us to resolve criticisms regarding notions
of *support*, interface and device, as covered in the second chapter. We
develop the concept of mediating conjunctures because the word
'mediation' suggests the existence of a single mediating element,
structured and defined that – as the combustion engine described by
Bachimont – would transform space into time, completely determining
every event produced within the frame of the mediation. As in the case
described by Matteo Treleani,[^04chapter3_2] who asserts that a user before a web
document is as an automaton, that is to say that in a nearly mechanic
way he performs actions that are measured by the mediating device: one
click on a link, then another, and one sees a series of actions framed
by a mechanic and algorithmic procedure. The idea of mediating
conjunctures is, on the contrary, based on the conviction that what
mediates does not exist before mediation. There is no prefabricated tool
which, all of a sudden, mediates the actions by shaping them: the
mediating contexts arise at the same moment as the action, and they are
multiple and moving, and this is why we can understand them as operating
at the conjunctures of many elements.

Thus understood in their multiplicity, mediating conjunctures cannot be
associated with an essence. Trying to grasp and characterize them in a
stable and fixed manner can only occur at the risk of disregarding the
movement by discretizing its continuity. Therefore, we can select a
determined time interval – a second, a minute, an hour, but also a
period – and try to identify the characteristics of a mediating
conjuncture during this time interval. Alternatively, as in the
schooling fish example, we can turn our gaze to a determined part of the
space. But this part will never be motionless, as it is our gaze that
disregards the changes by behaving as though certain characteristics of
the mediating conjunctures remain more or less the same during this time
interval.

We will return to the example of theatrical action to which we have
already alluded. When we refer to 'theatrical' action, we use the
adjective in order to refer to a particular mediation that shapes and
contextualizes the action. The epithet 'theatrical' refers to a
mediating conjuncture that has been identified, grasped and described.
This is only possible because we have limited our gaze to one
predetermined part of time and space: we have disregarded other shifting
mediating conjunctures in order to concentrate on one point of view and
to isolate an ensemble of factors, the forces and the agents that we
gather under the term 'theatrical'. This mediating conjuncture ends up
crystallizing and making way for a particular medium: theater. The
notion of mediating conjunctures helps us to understand that this is an
essentialization that thereby consists in naming this activity
'theatrical' according to the needs of language. But this does not
correspond to the real state of things. In other terms, the adjective
'theatrical' is a word that serves to identify a complex and shifting
combination of elements that form the particular context for an action,
at the same moment that it is produced. This context cannot be a closed
and stable device that remains unchanged for all 'theatrical' actions,
be it present actions or passed actions.

In this sense, the difference between a theatrical action and a film
action or a reading action, or even a love action, is only a difference
of degree and not of nature. It is, in other words, a difference that
can be situated on a continuous spectrum: the different mediating
conjunctures are not divided and separated in a discrete manner. For
example, a theatrical action in the context of a contemporary play is
closer to a dance performance of the same period than a Molière play.
This perspective simultaneously allows us to take into account the
premediation that exists within each media practice without
essentializing it. This is at the heart of the notion of mediating
conjunctures.[^04chapter3_3]

Let us return to the example of theatrical action in order to explain
this point of view. If we imagine an actress, she is on stage, playing
the role of Phaedra. She speaks, she crosses the space, she looks, she
moves her hands, her body. There is something in the process of being
produced in the same instant that the actress acts: it is an action.
When the actress is in the process of doing something, her action is
what counts the most, the most important thing. The fact that this
action takes place in a theater, on a stage, is one of the aspects of
this action, but it is not the only one and, above all, it cannot be
separated from all the other aspects involved in the action. And yet we
have said that it is a 'theatrical' action, as this action is
characterized by a context, an art and a series of forces in play at the
moment that it is produced. There is a stage, a space in which the
action must take place. There is then a theater: a spatial device that
includes the stage and allows an audience to observe it. There is also a
text – Phaedra's replicas – that the actress has learnt and is in the
process of performing. There are a series of rehearsals during which the
actress has practiced her role and perfected it. There is also a certain
light, a certain temperature, the actress's physical condition, a
particular audience, a sound at the end of the room, a particular and
changing 'atmosphere'. As an ensemble, these elements cross one another
in creating particular conjunctures. To identify some of these elements
in play is evidently an abstraction: it is impossible to demarcate in a
predictable manner the perimeters of observation. For example: we can
take into consideration the health conditions of the actress and tie
them to a history of her illnesses since childhood – or place them in a
genealogical lineage; we could do the same thing for the spectators; we
could take into account the weather conditions and situate them in an
ensemble of atmospheric phenomena... and yet each action, theatrical or
not, is produced within the context of a particular ensemble of
mediating conjunctures. In the case of a 'theatrical' action, we find a
certain number of recurring elements that are more present than others:
the stage, the theater, the audience, the text, the rehearsals... These
interrelated elements contextualize the particular type of action that
we consider theatrical. From there we could isolate these elements and
say that they are a form of mediation or, even further, that they
constitute one defined media: the theater. The theater would be a medium
as it corresponds to a more or less stable ensemble of – seeing as this
varies – mediating conjunctures. Obviously, this formulation is
justified and can be very useful. When we buy a ticket to go to the
theater, or when we talk about the play *Phaedra* that we saw the
evening prior, the reality of being able to say that it was in fact the
theater is crucial. But this gesture involves isolating a certain number
of elements that constitute a mediating conjuncture, and naming it is
always an arbitrary gesture. Let us say, for example, that the actress
in question performs on the street, doing without the theater building
and the traditional stage, and a group of people stop to listen to her.
Could we say that this is not theater? And if we say that she does not
speak in French, but in Italian, thus distancing herself from Racine's
text, or even that she improvises a text that speaks of Phaedra but has
nothing to with the known texts, would we say that this is not theater?

We will later return to these questions, but we outline, for now, that
mediating conjunctures are never stable, and they never occur in exactly
the same way; they are always moving, always changing. This does not
prevent us from trying, for sake of analysis, to recognize elements in
the movement of mediating conjunctures in order to bring together a
certain number of actions, by characterizing them as being part of the
same type. The fact that mediating conjunctures are not graspable in
discrete units also depends on another factor that which we have just
described with the help of the stigmergy concept. The action that is
produced in the mediating conjunctures is also a part of mediating
conjunctures, as it is one of the elements in play during their
constitution. The actress that plays Phaedra participates, by her
action, in the mediating conjunctures within which she is placed. This
is precisely what the notion of stigmergy implies: the movement and the
behaviour of each animal contribute to the production of a dynamic
spatial structure – the school of fish or the ant hive or the spider's
web, but this spatial structure itself conditions the behaviour of the
animals. There is no 'school' without the movement of each fish, and yet
the movement of a fish or of a particular bird is initiated by the
structure of the school. It is obviously the movement of the spider that
determines the structure of the web, but at the same time the webs
architecture determines the movement. The two occur together because one
forms part of the other. The action that is produced in the mediating
conjuncture is at the same time conditioned by its mediating conjuncture
– as the latter is its context – but, in turn, it conditions and shapes
the mediating conjuncture. Without the actress who acts, the mediating
conjunctures would be different.

Another example could help to understand this complex relationship
between mediating conjunctures and action. We are, at this very moment,
in the process of writing. Our writing action is produced at the
crossroads of a series of forces in play at this very moment. There is a
room with a particular lighting. There is a computer – an entire series
of organized techniques and technologies, a tradition of writing, a play
with letters, a keyboard, a word processor with its complex history and
its relationships with other older word processors, a typewriter,
handwriting. There is our ability to write: the fact that we have learnt
a writing technique – first by hand, then we were able to adapt this
technique to a machine and eventually to a computer, to different word
processors, to different keyboards, to different writing situations and
finally to this particular writing situation that is occurring at this
very moment. There is a language, English. There is a body of work that
had been done prior to writing and that gave us ideas. There is the
desire to write, at this very moment, and the possibility of doing so.
All these elements are in place and they are the forces currently in
effect, in this precise instant when we are in the process of writing.
The history of writing or the history of our work to prepare this text
has meaning only because they have produced a force that is in action at
this very moment. And yet the fact that we are in the process of writing
is, itself, a force in play. The fact that we write forms part of the
mediating conjunctures that characterize this very instant. The proof
lies in the fact that what we write, the way we write, our movements on
the keyboard, but also the letters that we choose, the words that form,
all condition what follows. In other terms, our writing action is part
of a context in which this writing action is produced. Our writing
action produces the context that thereby renders it possible and shapes
it.

## The Dimensions of Mediating Conjunctures

Let us now try to analyze mediating conjunctures to provide an
interpretation of their various elements. We can analyze these elements
on the basis of three coexisting and complementary dimensions: a
technical dimension, a discursive dimension and a practical dimension.
The merging of these three dimensions is what we have described using
the stigmergy dynamic. The ensemble of these dimensions characterizes
all the moving forces that come into play in mediating conjunctures.

1.  Each action falls within a particular technical context. Therefore,
    the actress who acts forms part of a heterogenous ensemble made up
    of techniques ranging from architectural approaches to the theater's
    construction, to sound devices, to acting, etc. A user who creates a
    Facebook profile acts within a technical context characterized by
    information protocols, machines, algorithms, ergonomics... As
    outlined, it is impossible to demarcate this context in a single
    way. There is a not *one* theatrical technique, given that the
    ensemble of technical approaches in play in each context is very
    heterogenous. Therefore, we refer to technology in order to make
    reference to this heterogenous assemblage that refers to the
    competencies and tools that, given their complex history, can hardly
    be considered a homogenous whole. We can say that this heterogenous
    ensemble of techniques creates a space in which the action then
    takes place, and we can thereby tie this technical dimension of
    mediating conjunctures to the spatial aspect determining the actions
    analyzed in the previous chapter. We will return to the examples of
    theatrical actions and writing actions in order to better understand
    what we call the technical dimension of mediating conjunctures. In
    the moment that she acts, the actress finds herself in a particular
    space. This space is the ensemble of relationships tying the stage
    to the audience – the orientation of seats, the height of the stage
    in relation to the auditorium, the placement of the theater wings –,
    but that also tie the different objects on stage to one another –
    the scenography, the position of other actors –, and that tie
    together the ensemble of the 'theater' structure with its external
    factors – the theater's location, for example. The actress's action,
    her acting, only has meaning because it takes place in a particular
    spatial context: she is on the stage, there is an audience watching
    her, she finds herself in a theater, this theater is in the center
    of, say, Montreal, or even in the suburbs of New York. And yet this
    space is not simply the ensemble of elements and forces present but,
    moreover, as we have said, the ensemble of relations that bind them
    together. This is why this space can be considered the technical
    dimension of mediating conjunctures; elements such as lighting or
    acoustics are part of the spatial context. The relationship between
    the actors and the audience is not defined simply by the distance or
    geometrical position of the stage in relation to the auditorium and
    the theater boxes, but also by the fact that a particular lighting
    device enables the stage to be seen by the spectators, and the
    sounds produced to be heard. All of the technical and technological
    devices in place form part of the spatial context that produces
    them. If there is a microphone, or a video recorder, or a computer
    that connects another theater via videoconference, these apparatus
    also form part of the spatial context because they contribute to
    building relationships between objects.

2.  The technical dimension is necessarily accompanied by a discursive –
    or cultural – dimension, without which the other would not make
    sense. This is what we have demonstrated in our discussion on
    sociomedialities. It is not, as we henceforth highlight, an abstract
    or immaterial aspect of mediating conjunctures. The discursive
    dimension is made up of the ensemble of documents, texts, or other
    forms of traces on which our interpretation of the world is
    based.[^04chapter3_4] These diverse documents, traditions and traces give way
    to a series of interpretative tendencies that shape the action at
    any given moment. The actress acts because there is a text -- in our
    example Racine's text. She also acts because there is a tradition
    wherein the theater means something for a group of people or a
    society. There are texts that have been studied and transmitted, a
    learning that occurs at school – or elsewhere –, a familiarity with
    the device that is possible thanks only to the sharing of communal
    textual or informational references. The ensemble of these
    references is shared by the audience – each member of the public in
    their own way –, by the actors, by the director. And these
    references are also shifting, as they do not cease to change and
    produce the context for the action. If we study these forces, we can
    identify particular tendencies that characterize a given moment, or
    a period, or a society. We could, for example, argue that a period
    is characterized by the strong importance of the concept of
    representation. Or again a certain culture is founded on a
    particular idea of the world's hierarchy. To identify this is, of
    course, a discretization, as these forces are in movement.
    Identifying a symbolic tendency is taking into account a norm at the
    center of a dynamic and changing landscape. The coincidence of a
    series of symbolic tendencies gives way to conjunctures that can be
    identified as given forms of mediation: for example, the theater.
    But in this instance, also, identifying this is an abstraction, a
    necessity of language – as we will see in more detail in the next
    chapter. Discursive aspects are fundamental in understanding
    mediating conjunctures also because they are not necessarily in
    harmony with technical features. Industry discourse relating to
    high-fidelity sound and image reproduction technology is an example.
    To understand the specificity of digital sound we must, on the one
    hand, understand technical sampling and discretization of analogue
    sound and, on the other hand, understand industrial discourse that –
    as opposed to technical realities – presents this sampling as a
    faithful representation of the continued realities of sound. CDs
    are, at the same time, a reproducing technique that reduces
    'fidelity' to the reality of sound, but also a cultural object that,
    according to this industry's discourse, results in higher fidelity.
    This paradox is unsurprising given the complex and shifting
    multiplicity of mediating conjunctures. It is precisely what Éric
    Méchoulan proposes when he defines intermediality as a hermeneutics
    of *supports*: 'with intermediality, we are not interested in the
    hidden meanings beyond the text, but in the operations that unite
    matter, forms, social usage, scholarly practices, the historicity of
    phenomena and authorizing institutions'.[^04chapter3_5] In this sense, the
    *support* is no longer a stable premediating technique, but a
    dynamic produced by the interlacing forces put in play in a
    particular moment.

3.  Lastly, we must underline the practical dimension of mediating
    conjunctures, which refers to the fact that actions taking place
    form part of these conjunctures and structure them. The action is
    made possible by the context wherein it is produced but, at the same
    time, it is precisely what puts it in place. If the actress's role
    had not existed, there would not have been, in this precise case, a
    play, there would not have been a stage, there would not even have
    been lighting, or a microphone. And, more generally, without acting,
    there would have been neither a theater nor theatrical devices. In
    the same way, if there had been no users that created their Facebook
    profile, there would be no Facebook. We will later return to this
    fundamental aspect.

Let us illustrate the coexistence of these three dimensions with the
help of an example, that of digital photography. We could argue that
digital photography is a separate *medium* that emerges as a result of
the development of preceding *media*, while obviously remaining separate
from these phenomena. Indeed, it is a particular technique that puts in
place specific conditions that can thereby be described by a series of
essential and defining features. But separating digital photography from
preceding *media* is not commensurate with actual practices. We could
say that digital techniques allow us to immediately capture a particular
moment, without the need of posing subjects, in at once obtaining the
photographic result of the photo – which does not need to be printed in
a laboratory. But we could also consider things differently by trying to
capture the mediating conjunctures that constitute the photographic
moment (the moment wherein one triggers the shutter open). We will see
that a series of ideas, of tendencies, of conditions constitute the
elements put into play which trigger the shutter open. These tendencies
are not specific to digital photography: what brings about a digital
photo is the conjuncture of these tendencies that converge when the
camera 'clicks'. In particular, the idea of having subjects that are not
posing. This idea is already present in photography prior to the
digital. From the 1930s, we have in fact begun to take portraits of
ordinary situations, without staging the photographic subjects. In
family albums, we can notice that the portraits, where everybody is
positioned and posing for the photograph, have been replaced with more
'natural' photos. In the field of artistic photography, we could
reference Doisneau and his 'stolen moments'. But this tendency existed
even before the photo: let us think, for example, of Caravaggio's
portraits. *Saint Matthew*, for example, with his dirty foot pointed
towards the viewer, is a painting profoundly marked by this tendency.

As for the rapid acquisition of the final product – the digital photo
does not need to be developed and printed –, we notice that this
tendency is identifiable prior to digital photography: in 1948, for
example, the Polaroid appeared. But also, before the Polaroid, one
described the skill of a painter by pointing out their speed, and their
ability to capture a moment – such as the impressionists. To these, we
add a particular technique, that of the *camera obscura* which, if it
was undeniably at the center of photographic development, also
characterized painting, at lease from the Venetian Veduta. Instead of
identifying digital photography as a separate medium, we could therefore
concentrate on the practice of taking a photo – the very moment that the
photo is taken – and analyze the ensemble of tendencies that are
activated at this precise moment: this is what it means to account for
*mediating conjunctures*.[^04chapter3_6]

Servanne Monjour analyzes this complex mechanism of dialogue between
techniques, discourse and practice in the context of digital photography
by referring to 'remanence'.[^04chapter3_7] The idea of remanence allows a
reinterpretation of the notion of remediation as defined by Bolter and
Grusin in *Understanding New Media*, all while avoiding the major
pitfall of this essay, which is a certain teleological temptation that
we have already referred to. The impression we have when reading the two
media theoreticians (at least focusing on this landmark work) is that
the remediation phenomenon is part of a globally linear process. The
idea of remanence avoids this pitfall by producing unforeseeable and
intertwined non-linear processes. There is therefore remanence of
analogue structures in digital photography practices – such as, for
example, the 'analogue' effects of digital devices –, but there is, at
the same time, paradoxically, digital remanence in analogue practices.
For example, the idea of the virtual image was indeed the basis of
analogue photographic discourse: the negative is the virtual that is
then updated through a series of different prints. And yet this virtual
image seems retroactively borrowed from our ordinary digital image –
notably that of the Raw image file. We are faced with an element that is
established in reverse:

> Therefore, the conditions of conveying an idea participate entirely in
> its invention, even if it means integrating it, in reverse, into a
> tradition, that is, retroactively associating it with a meaning that
> it has perhaps not (yet) entirely had – or, in certain cases, that it
> did not have at all.[^04chapter3_8]

This approach therefore allows us to avoid a teleological vision of
media's progress. There is not, in other terms, a linear development of
all media that would become more and more transparent, for example, as
in the illustrious metaphor of the 'Black Box' that Henry Jenkins[^04chapter3_9]
denounces, as well as what we have seen in this chapter. The change of
mediatic practices often occurs following an oscillation of ideas and
tendencies that more or less have a strong influence on these practices
according to the moment in consideration. During a certain period, for
example, the notion of representation could be dominant enough to alter
artistic practices. The desire of representation as an action consists
in rendering present something that will no longer be, during a given
period, one of the forces that, for example, leads to making a painting
or to staging a theater play. This thirst for representation inevitably
generates the development of techniques and apparatus that allow us to
render present that which is not or, at least, to give us the illusion –
perspective, the *camera obscura*, photography, the phonograph, etc. In
their essay, *Remediation. Understanding New Media*, Bolter and Grusin
in this way attempt to identify the vast historical periods wherein the
principle of 'immediacy' was dominant, which we assimilate with the
representational system. But they are also interested in other
historical moments that they associate with hypermediacy, wherein this
desire is less evident. This is the case in the 20th and 21st centuries,
primarily in the visual arts field. The very concept of representation
competes with other aspects of artistic experience as in, for example,
life. If we think about the effects of the analogue that digital photo
software offers, it is clear that the desire of representation has been
replaced by other desires. Obviously, we cannot think this reduction of
want of representation as progress: criticizing the idea of
representation was fundamental in Plato's thinking, which did not
prevent a great comeback of *mimesis* in other historical periods, as
well as its decline in others. It really relates to an oscillating
movement. But this movement does not, as Bolter and Grusin suggest,
limit itself to two poles – namely, immediacy and hypermediacy. In
moving towards representation, other tendencies arise, for example the
tendency to create world hierarchies in structured taxonomies, the
tendency to organize complex linear structures, the tendency to
mathematize reality, or the tendency to create networks (that we observe
with the Romans, builders of road networks, with the English *Railway
mania* and *Canal mania*, with internet pioneers...). We could identify
an ensemble of tendencies to describe particular mediating conjunctures.
It is what we will do in the last chapter of this work in an attempt to
justify the mediating conjunctures that crystallize today with a
substantive adjective: 'the digital'.

It now remains to see how these forces and tendencies can be interpreted
not only as factors that frame and shape the action, but also, and above
all, as performative elements. This will be our focus in the following
pages.

## Performativity and Metaontology

Defining mediating conjunctures, as we have seen, can be misleading. To
grasp the moving forces that characterize the moment of an action, to
describe them, leads us back to giving a name to a context that
eventually becomes a particular *medium*. If we are capable of
identifying the spatial, symbolic or material characteristics of a given
moment, we must also be capable of naming this context, of freezing it,
and of making it a concept. In other words, it would be possible to say
that a particular ensemble of mediating conjunctures is theater, another
radio, another television, another writing on the computer... But in
this way, our interest in the notion of mediating conjunctures
disappears.

As we have seen, the intermedial approach tries to resolve this problem
by concentrating on the dynamic that leads to the production of
mediations rather than on the media itself. And yet with this approach,
one still runs risk of essentializing the process. Intermediality, in
fact, always runs the risk of becoming an ontology. We have shown that,
in the first phase of its history, intermediality would concentrate on
the idea of an in-between that in some way ends up essentializing the
poles that it sought to emancipate. If intermediality is what is found
between many media, from this arises an essentializing determination of
these media. In the *postmediatic approach*, one puts aside the idea of
medium and insists on the importance of the remediation dynamic and on
what Lars Elleström calls 'media transformation'. This movement, that
manifests as a result of a growing lack of differentiation between media
and an erasure of the barriers that demarcate them – think about a
television system and home cinema or current mobile phones and their
multifunctional qualities – is precisely what highlights the centrality
of mediation and medialities. It is otherwise on the basis of these
medialities that the transmedial dynamic is founded: the mediatic
contents are treated and distributed in accordance with specific
medialities. This indicates well that, if there are no longer media, we
are not in an unclear continuum where it would be impossible – even
unreasonable – to identify a particular mediatic situation.[^04chapter3_10]

If intermediality does participate in this performative shift marking
the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, the idea of
mediating conjunctures discussed here marks a crucial step in the
development of thinking about mediation, as well as that of
performativity. Intermediality is, above all, performative, regardless
of the period and regardless of the system – mediatic, postmediatic –
beneath which it manifests. By resorting to this idea of mediating
conjunctures, we advance reflection on performativity by reversing a
solidly entrenched logic. Our approach is not isolated, but part of a
larger movement that we could consider 'mediationist', that varies from
media theory (Galloway) to *new materialism* (De Landa, Braidotti) or to
Karen Barad's *agential realism*. According to Barad, 'reality is not
composed of things-in-themselves or things-behind-phenomena but
"things"-in-phenomena'.[^04chapter3_11] From this logical shift, and its
considerable repercussions, emerged the major concept of intra-activity.
Within the intermedial field that interests us, what we consider to be
mediating conjunctures largely corresponds to the intra-active dynamic
observed in agential realism. While mediatic intermediality relies on
interaction, postmediatic intermediality would rely on intra-action.
While the first assumes the pre-existence of predetermined independent
entities to be related to one another, it is on the other hand 'through
specific agential intra-actions that the boundaries and properties of
the "components" of phenomena become determinate and that particular
embodied concepts become meaningful'.[^04chapter3_12]

If mediating conjunctures are always something specific, the question
therefore arises: how do we consider the difference between one
mediating conjuncture in relation to another without falling into a
mediatic essentialism? In other words: is it possible to not abandon a
discussion on the specificities of certain mediating conjunctures
without adopting an essentialist approach?

We propose – more as a possible opening for future research than as a
genuine solution – adopting an approach that could be described as
'meta-ontological'. The core principle of metaontology is that Being is
always the result of the mediation process. Instead of thinking of a
Being in itself which is thereafter meditated to give way to a Being for
us, or a representational Being, metaontology considers mediations as
original.[^04chapter3_13] We could therefore adopt an ontological approach, which
aims to grasp the specificity of mediating conjunctures, without
renouncing their elusive nature. Indeed, the originality of mediations
implies an original multiplicity of Beings, and therefore a multiplicity
of ontologies.

Beyond falling into a unique definitional approach to ontology, which
crystallizes the real into stable concepts, metaontology positions
itself in ways other than that of ontology, in a way that allows us to
take into account the multiplicity of ontologies. This 'meta' must not
be interpreted as an overriding: metaontology takes into account the
multiplicity of ontologies without presenting itself as a super-system,
precisely because it recognizes the irreducibility of different
ontologies. From a metaontological point of view, the real is a dynamic
of entwined ontological planes. There is no essence of things, but a
plurality of essences that encroach upon one another. There is no Being,
but a plurality of multiple-beings. In accepting this original and
irreducible multiplicity, we consider metaontology a performative
discourse on the essences whose entwined dynamic constitutes as the real
– or, more precisely, the reals.

According to a metaontological approach, what we say, here and now, on
mediating conjunctures is one of many interactions that determine its
emergence. But this emergence is always tied to a precise context that
makes the essence of mediating conjunctures plural and dynamic.
Metaontology is therefore a performative discourse that is here at this
very instant of writing. What is produced then – this writing that is a
discourse on mediating conjunctures – is metaontology. Metaontology is
found in mediating conjunctures and, at the same time, it produces it.
The fact that at this very moment we write, produces the very meaning of
this writing. However, we are in the process of speaking of mediating
conjunctures – we are in the process of trying to grasp them. But this
act, as a metaontological act, is not an attempt to pin down or
crystallize them: we do not define mediating conjunctures. We express
them. We express them because the mediating conjunctures that we are in
the process of talking about are nothing more than the ensemble that is
in the process of being produced in the very instant that we are in the
process of writing. These mediating conjunctures are, at the same time,
the product and the condition of possibility of that which is in the
process of happening while we write. Metaontology is the act of
expressing, in a space detached from ontologies, that which is produced
at the very moment of this discourse. At the same time, it is entirely
thrown into the flow of reality and detached from the discrete time that
founds the possibility of essences.

The metaontological approach can therefore take into account the
dynamics, oscillating between performativity and identifying mediating
conjunctures, and help us to characterize mediatic practices without
reducing them to fixed and essential units. This leads us to analyze the
process of naturalization which presents itself as the inevitable
aftermath of any performative gesture. This is covered in the following
chapter.

    Cinema? A Medium in Crisis in the Digital Age*, New York: Columbia
    University Press, 2015. What we are trying to highlight with our
    expression is the dispersed aspect of mediating conjunctures: a
    multiplicity of mediation elements that cannot – or not necessarily
    – be classified and organized into a single 'series'. To identify
    the development trajectories that would be the most important, or
    more noteworthy than others, in fact risks returning to a form of
    essentialism. The utility of the cultural series is that it finds a
    relationship between different media experiences that can be
    integrated into the same history. In the case of mediating
    conjunctures, it is not a matter of accepting that every history of
    each media practice is only one of many avenues of possible
    interpretations.

    the action: there are multiple histories relating to the many
    different elements. One cannot include the ensemble of mediating
    conjunctures in a continuous series. If a link exists between
    cultural series and mediating conjunctures, it is that the latter
    can be thought of as the crossing over of different cultural series.

# Mediating Conjunctures and Mediation

In the previous chapter, we explained why we prefer 'mediating
conjunctures' to the concept of 'medium', which still dominates media
studies and communications. We propose this shift not only because of
the growing difficulty of defining an individual medium but also, more
generally, in response to the complexity of mediation phenomena as they
manifest themselves in the present day. This is not a matter of
tinkering with our conceptual apparatus to account for a more elusive
reality. What is at stake is our ability to develop new tools to better
grasp the scope of the mediation processes – of which we are, in one way
or another, the agents – and the issues they raise.

In this chapter, we will continue our discussion of mediating
conjunctures, focussing on what they produce, namely mediation *per se*.
Our purpose is to show how this conceptual shift fits into a broad
epistemological renewal rooted in a new way of thinking about ourselves
as human beings acting in the world.

We will follow the same route as in Chapter 1, beginning with an
overview of the mechanisms at work in any mediation process, as
understood during the mediatic period of intermedial thinking, and then
looking at the model's shortcomings and why we need to move beyond it to
grasp the nature of mediation in the postmediatic age and its associated
issues. We will conclude by proposing a new definition of mediation,
that is, by describing what occurs when a set of mediating conjunctures
is operative.

## Historical Perspectives on Mediation: Individuation, Naturalization and Sociomedialities

While resisting the essentialist temptation to posit historically
specific phenomena as ahistorical constants, we cannot ignore the hold
that words have on our way of being in the world. Indeed, we would say
that their relative stability is, in many ways, the mainstay of
community life. We communicate a fluid reality using frozen forms, a
tension that parallels the paradox of flux and the photogram, the
contradiction between the flow of lived reality and the limited, static
representation captured by a snapshot. We include these two dimensions,
the communicational and the representational, in this brief historical
overview advisedly, for they are the site of the fundamental problems
for the concept of mediation today.

Historically, mediation has consisted of differentiating what would
otherwise be undifferentiated and indissociable from an amorphous mass
or flow. Any mediation is accompanied by a process of singularization,
or what we have been calling discretization. We can identify two types
of discretization processes: polarization and individuation. Both are
discursive in nature.

Polarization splits a segment of reality in two: it creates a polarity
between two elements that are placed in opposition to form a binary
structure. The segmentation of reality that it effects is clearly
arbitrary and not rooted in any 'natural' necessity, for reality is
continuous. Polarization is the foundation of the general laws of logic:
the principles of non-contradiction and excluded middle. It cannot be
day and night at once (principle of non-contradiction), for language
identifies night with not-day. It's either day or night; there is no
third option (principle of excluded middle).

The second form of discretization of reality is individuation. Richard
Grusin, the coauthor of *Remediation: Understanding New Media*, which we
have discussed[^05chapter4_1] and to which we shall return, defines mediation as
'the process, action, or event that generates or provides the conditions
for the emergence of subjects and objects, for the individuation of
entities within the world'.[^05chapter4_2]

Such entities can be constituted only if we take a section of the whole,
isolate it, and consider it as a unit in and of itself. This entails
drawing a precise line through the continuity of reality. Quantitative
measurements are one example: a litre is a discrete part carved out of a
continuous mass. The litre is 'individuated', separated from the rest.
In the case of units of measurement, the demarcation is entirely
arbitrary. In others, it may be based on characteristic features made
salient by the process of polarization: referring to mammals focuses
attention on certain characteristics of animals, to the exclusion of all
others. The concept of medium arises precisely from such a process of
individuation, starting from the dynamic and complex reality of
practices.

By practices, we mean characteristics that are common to different
actions. Agent A performs action X, agent B performs action Y. Actions X
and Y are enmeshed in a series of elements: a context (C), a space (S),
a time (T), a set of ideas and values (I), technological devices (D) and
so forth. When one or more of these elements are the same or similar,
when they converge, we can speak of a practice.

Let us say, for example, that actions X and Y share C and D. We then
have a practice we may call CD. If, at 4 p.m. on April 4, Luca (L) takes
a photo of Montreal from the lookout on Mount Royal (action X), and at 8
a.m. on June 20, Jean takes a photo of the Eiffel Tower from the
Champ-de-Mars (action Y), there are some common features to the two
actions. Similar devices were used (even if we don't know the specific
cameras with which Luca and Jean took their photos); in both cases a
cityscape was photographed; and so forth. We may therefore speak of a
'photographic' practice.

Clearly, practices can be organized into broader or more precise
categories, depending on the elements taken into consideration. 'Vermeer
paints a view of Delft in 1660' (action Z) could be said to share some
elements with the two previous actions. We could then speak of a
'cityscape representation practice'. Or we could specify that Luca and
Jean took their photographs with smartphones and define the practice as
'smartphone photography'.

Specifying the common thread by which media practices are defined
constitutes the individuation process for that practice. Once a set of
practices has been individuated, it can be assigned a name, understood
and interpreted as a unit. This is the process that leads to the
identification of what we call 'theater', 'radio', 'television', 'music'
and 'cinema', to name just a few examples.

In this sense, the practices we include under the rubric 'cinema' are
not discontinuous with the ones we call 'photography' or 'theater'. The
discontinuity resides in the names we assign to them, which are produced
by a process of discretization.

The arbitrary nature of these processes would be less problematic were
it not for the fact that they are a way of structuring reality. As we
have said, polarization and individuation are products of language. This
observation takes us back to the performative dimension of language. As
Austin demonstrated, language does more than convey messages; it 'does'
things in the world and, in a way, creates reality. But more than this,
the process of discretization also has an institutionalizing effect.
Discourse not only produces the entities it names, but it endows them
with an institutional existence and an ontological status. Certainly,
the institutionalizing effect is not automatic: it isn't enough to name
a polarity or an individuality for it to attain an institutional
existence. The discourse that produces the discretization must
circulate, must be shared, and must stabilize: it must always say more
or less the same thing (or at least give the impression of doing
so).[^05chapter4_3]

To return to the example of units of measure, the definition of a meter
is not rooted in any necessity: the same distance could be measured in
inches, or leagues, or miles. But a discourse emerged, first in the
scientific community, then in business practices, and eventually became
the standard, in some communities, and stabilized. The
institutionalization of a discretization process is bound up with
specific, and yet shifting mediating conjunctures that are at once its
original environment and its product. Obviously, one could propose a
different unit of measure and challenge the institutionalization of the
meter, but before another institutionalization process can take hold, it
would have to stabilize and be shared across the community in question.
Applied to media, institutionalization is the discursive process of
discretization that results in the emergence of a medium.

The stabilization of discourse, which completes the institutionalization
process, triggers another important phenomenon: the 'naturalization' of
the discretization and its transformation into something ageless. This
is accomplished when the discretization no longer needs to be justified,
when it no longer appears tied to cultural variables, but instead seems
to belong to the natural order of things.

In the case of media, a naturalized medium becomes a fixture of its
users' daily lived environment. In *When Old Technologies Were New*,[^05chapter4_4]
Carolyn Marvin provides a striking example of how a medium becomes
naturalized. She describes how the telephone entered the daily lives of
a steadily growing congregation of individuals (in homes, businesses and
organizations of all kinds), how it changed their lives and transformed
its users. She notes that it is always a small group of initiates that
promotes a new technology. At first, they are the only ones to master
its use and realize its utility. But unlike other types of knowledge,
this 'technological literacy' does not establish a permanent elite, for
it soon comes to be widely shared.[^05chapter4_5]

At the level of the user, naturalization has the effect of blurring the
distinction between the human and the non-human. Marshall McLuhan
defined media as 'extensions of man',[^05chapter4_6] but when media usage protocols
are assimilated by users to the extent of becoming automatic, it is hard
to say where the extension begins. Naturalization renders the mediation
transparent to the user of the medium. Saying 'hello' or 'I'm hanging
up', dialling a number, hearing a voice (or not) after several rings,
all belong to a body of knowledge that transmutes into a set of reflexes
on the part of the telephone user. These protocols might be expected to
accentuate the opacity of the mediation process, but instead they create
a transparent effect as a result of their assimilation by the user. The
varieties of opacification discussed in Chapter 1, exemplified by the
radiophonic voice that exposes the artifice of the theatrical voice, may
be understood as processes of 'denaturalization' (of what had previously
been naturalized).

We have been using the term 'sociomedialities' to describe these
specific socialities that give rise to media practices. Clearly, the
naturalization of discretization processes tends to render the
sociomedial dimensions of some individual and collective behaviours
commonplace or even invisible. It might be concluded that the concept is
not useful, since sociomedialities inevitably collapse into socialities.
But it must be borne in mind that 'new media', or new dominant trends
within mediating conjunctures are always appearing and disturbing users'
behaviours.

## Postmediatic Perspectives

Two points that emerge from this overview of mediation are worth noting.
The first is its anthropocentric nature. Everything revolves around the
(human) user, of whom media are understood as an extension. The
non-human, including technology, is subject to the human and serves to
increase human capabilities. This anthropocentrism breeds an
anthropomorphism that may well be called into question.

The second point is the pivotal position of language in this conception
of mediation. Language is central to the naming of the things we
singularize and to the new environment thereby created. These two
tendencies, anthropocentrism and logocentrism, are at the heart of
current debates in intermediality.

As we saw in Chapter 3, for mediation to exist there must be a
combination of elements that we have called 'mediating conjunctures'. A
notable feature of these elements, in addition to their shifting and
partly random nature, is their heterogeneity, consisting, as they do, of
human and non-human agents and variegated entities and phenomena. This
defining characteristic of mediating conjunctures stems from their
instability, their diversity and the fact that they are not exactly
reproducible. To Bolter and Grusin's contention that there is no
original mediation, we might add that any mediation is always new, or
better still there is never a mediation that is identifiable as such,
but always mediating conjunctures.

But this perpetual novelty is itself variable in scope and intensity. In
a given space of time – and both time and space may be extended – the
degree of novelty may be relatively weak, and mediating conjunctures may
be grouped together on the basis of similarities, or what Wittgenstein
called 'family resemblance'. Likenesses of this kind ground categories
such as the arts, which have been distinguished from other types of
mediation and also divided into subcategories, such as the temporal arts
and the spatial arts, or distinguished on the basis of certain aspects
of the devices they employ, such as the use of words, musical notes,
drawings, etc. These entities were then named and organized into a
hierarchy, which has changed over time.[^05chapter4_7] Of course, the essentialist
naming of the conjunctures not only discretizes, but also reifies them,
concealing to some degree their fundamental and dynamic characteristics.

What is true of the arts applies as well to media. The term 'medium' as
we refer to the it here was, in the late 19th century, both of the need
to distinguish traditional representational practices – the arts – from
new practices in which the non-human occupied a hitherto unknown role
(thanks to the growing use of electricity and the fast-paced development
of sound and image reproduction technologies). This revolution in
agency, by which we mean the scope and nature of the role that various
agents play in mediation processes, did not occur without friction.
Resistance sprang up, nourished by explicitly anti-mechanical and
technophobic discourses, often tinged with nostalgia. In the 1930s,
while Henri Gouhier was seeking the 'essence' of theater (in our terms,
a nexus of mediating conjunctures that is stable over time) in the live
and 'real' co-presence of actor and spectator, independent of any
technical mediation, Walter Benjamin was developing the concept of the
aura (which can be understood as a specific quality of certain forms of
mediation that weakens with the intercession of non-human agents,
mechanical or technological).

Postmediatic intermediality reflects the mediation processes it
describes: it not only takes note of the role of the non-human in
mediation, but strives to understand how the human and non-human are
intertwined, by a logic other than the subjection of one to the other.
Intermedial research on contemporary theater (in which technology
figures prominently in the form of reproduced images on the stage, the
use of microphones, sound environments, etc.) is a good example. From
the outset, the intermedial approach was distinguished by its concern
with what was then called the materiality of media, and it made an
important contribution to re-evaluating the role of the non-human in the
development and operation of mediating conjunctures. The new value it
ascribed to the non-human represented a departure from the
anthropocentric conception of technology inherited from McLuhan.[^05chapter4_8]
Considerable effort was devoted to understanding the specific dynamic of
the non-human and its modes of interaction with human agents. A prime
example is the research on virtual reality, and on synthetic characters.
At the same time, the admission of the non-human considerably expanded
the already vast arena in which mediating conjunctures are produced and
operate. This necessarily brings us back to the foundation of all
mediation: its performative character and the nature of that
performativity.

## The Formless: Beyond Language

A few years before Gouhier embarked on his quest for the constants that
define theater and endow it with a specific 'essence', and Benjamin
began framing his intuited 'aura' in theoretical terms, the French
writer Georges Bataille decried the unhappy effect of words on our
perception of the world. To elude their reifying and reductive power,
Bataille proposed a new kind of dictionary, one that 'would begin from
the point at which it no longer rendered the meanings of words but
rather their tasks'.[^05chapter4_9]

Beyond his distrust of words, Bataille's aim was to free humans from the
grip of the sign and the inseparability of signifier and signified, the
cornerstone of the then-ascendant structuralist school in linguistics.
Bataille refused to collapse the totality of experience into our
acquaintance with the invented forms that are words and their meanings.
The paradox Bataille confronted is the same as the one we have discussed
in preceding chapters: the words that are supposed to describe the world
mask it in the act of description. The result, complains Bataille, is a
radical disjunction between the linguistic sur-reality that is supposed
to represent the world and reality itself, to which language, with its
limitations, cannot gain access. What interested Bataille, though, was
not so much the limits of language, as reality itself, the object of his
quest. He called it 'the formless', a notion he developed in the margins
of and in connection with the surrealist movement. Formlessness was an
attempt, then, to speak the ungraspable, and the concept opens the door
to what might be called a poetics of the unexpressed.

Bataille provides no satisfactory illustration of the formless,[^05chapter4_10]
nor, of course, any clear, stable definition of the concept, which would
have been a logical contradiction. But some characteristics recur in his
discussions of the notion: it is heterogeneous, ungraspable and a
process.

This last point is particularly interesting for the intermedial
approach. It recalls Aristotle's view of matter as an undifferentiated
mass that is individuated and rendered recognizable and classifiable by
form. Bataille plainly had this in mind, as the entry for 'formless' in
his *Dictionnaire critique* makes clear: 'Thus *formless* is not only an
adjective with a given meaning but a term which declassifies, generally
requiring that each thing take on a form'.[^05chapter4_11] The act of
declassification therefore demands both the presence and negation of
form: the formless is not just the absence of form but also, at the same
time and inseparably, its active suppression. From this perspective,
then, the formless possesses a destructive dimension that is,
paradoxically, also a gateway to something else. Bataille's dictionary
would 'no longer \[render\] the meanings of words but rather their
tasks'[^05chapter4_12] and it was through those tasks that the reader, listener or
spectator would open up to the presence of the formless and experience
it. The formless contains a strong performative vein even as it calls
for a redefinition of agency.

But at the heart of Bataille's liberation struggle is not so much this
aspect, but rather his distrust of words. He wants, first and foremost,
to wrestle himself free of the exclusive authority of the sign and the
signifier/signified pairing which, in limiting and imprisoning the
formless, reifies it and substitutes it for the plenitude of experience,
and the company of human language, an invented form that is at once
arbitrary, reductive and plural. In conceiving formlessness, Bataille
not only rejects the cohesion of the sign but discredits the efficacy of
all representation, viewed as autarkic, self-constructed, narcissistic
artifice in the final analysis. In other words, signs (particularly but
not exclusively linguistic signs) are tools for the subjugation of the
non-human to the human. It is this anthropomorphic, anthropocentric
dimension of form, and the self-containment it effects that Georges
Didi-Huberman underscores in *La ressemblance humaine ou le gai savoir
selon George Bataille*.[^05chapter4_13]

A startlingly inventive writer though he was, Bataille was unable to
describe the formless other than by what it is not. It's easy to see
why: how can one say the unsayable within the bounds of language? This
question marks the limits of the logical framework within which Bataille
was operating, namely the logocentric outlook for which language is the
privileged means of apprehending the world and all that exists that can
be apprehended by language. While Bataille had the intuition that there
was something beyond communication, he did not move beyond a preliminary
stage of reflection, one that consisted not so much of blazing new
trails towards the vast continent of the formless, as of dismantling the
routes that do not lead there. His enterprise heralds the great debates
that would attend the rise and fall of semiotics – and of linguistics in
general – but its lasting importance resides mainly in this fundamental
and fraught question, precisely because it is counterintuitive: what is
the undifferentiated? To ask this question also involves asking how the
undifferentiated is to be mediated, regardless of whether it was always
undifferentiated or became so when detached from human language.

These questions raised by Bataille nearly a century ago are at the
center of today's intermedial debates and they are key to uncovering the
workings of the mediating conjunctures at the heart of our discussion
here. The concepts of 'radical mediation' and 'excommunication' that
have been advanced recently, and the issues surrounding the
naturalization of mediation processes and their artefacts that we
discuss here, attest to the currency of Bataille's questions today and
to the counterintuitive character of postmediatic intermediality.

## Radical Mediation: Updating the Remediation Model

In Chapter 1, we looked at some limitations of the remediation model and
showed how other, non-transformational dynamics could connect mediating
practices such as hypermediality and transmediality. Independently
pursuing his investigation of mediation processes that had begun with
Jay D. Bolter, Richard Grusin has returned to the remediation model in
order to clarify some of its basic features. Notwithstanding the modesty
of this claim, the changes he has proposed to the model are substantial
and contribute to a renewed conception of mediation, which Bataille
would have undoubtedly welcomed. Grusin's reconsideration of the key
remedial concepts of transparency, immediacy, opacity and hypermediacy
produced the essay *Premediation:* *Affect and Mediality After 9/11* in
2010 and then the substantive article 'Radical Mediation' in 2015.

During the 16 years between the publication of *Remediation:
Understanding New Media* and 'Radical Mediation', Grusin disentangled
the concepts of transparency and immediacy that had been bound together
in the category 'transparent immediacy'. This is a turning point, for
with this move Grusin frees mediation from the representational yoke to
which he and Bolter had originally tied it to. This liberated mediation
is what he calls 'radical mediation'. And Grusin goes further still. He
argues that immediacy is limited neither to the products of mediation,
nor to its erasure – *i.e.*, its transparency – and, what's more, that
it is mediation itself that is immediate: 'Mediation is not opposed to
immediacy but rather is itself immediate'.[^05chapter4_14]

Grusin returns – or rather relegates – the two-pronged concept of
transparent immediacy to an instance of 'media correlationism', which
might be regarded as an updated version of the historical notion of a
copy's fidelity to the original. Likening transparent immediacy to a
theory that originates in the speculative realist school is a momentous
shift that marks a radical turn in Grusin's thinking. More notably
still, Grusin expands the definition of mediation from an in-between to
a general process of differentiation of all things in the world, human
and non-human.

How does this major amendment to the remediation model by one of its
authors help advance thinking about mediating conjunctures? In two ways.
First, it tacks towards performativity. Grusin's 'immediate mediation'
now includes what might be called 'intransitive mediation' – that is,
mediation that essentially refers to nothing beyond what occurs at the
moment of mediation: no model is transmitted, no pre-existing before or
elsewhere is summoned in the here and now of the mediation.

Secondly, and paradoxically, this development leads to an impasse that,
while not invalidating the remediation model, limits its scope and, most
importantly, forces us to rethink mediation. In solving one problem, the
model's confinement within the realms of representational logic, Grusin
creates another, one that is highly instructive. He says: 'Where
remediation focused largely on the visual aspects of mediation, radical
mediation would take into account the entire human sensorium'.[^05chapter4_15] This
passage and others from the landmark article suggest that, like Bolter,
Grusin has trouble conceiving visual mediation outside of
representational logic, which is why he entirely abandons the concept of
opacity – it is never mentioned in the article – and also why he
concludes that immediacy makes the concept of transparency inoperative
and useless. However, stating that mediation is immediate is
insufficient for defining it. By excluding the interplay between
transparency and opacity from the scope of his inquiry, Grusin forgoes
an essential analytic tool.

Let us compare a tightrope walker and a magic show. In both cases,
unless the performance contains an overlaid narrative that refers to
something beyond itself, the mediation is intransitive: the circus
performer walks the tightrope, the magician performs his trick. It all
happens in the here and now of the show. But there is a basic difference
between the two: we assume there is no trick to the high-wire act, and
yet we constantly seek one in the magic show, as we know it exists.
What, then, do we see in these performances? In the first, we see
everything; in the second, everything except the thing we're looking
for, even though it's there. The magic show is a paradoxical show of not
showing: we see that we don't see. So this is not opacity as it is
understood in the classic representational paradigm, an opacity that
obscures, masks or, in Zola's terms, 'distorts' that which ought to be
represented transparently. In this case, nothing is being re-presented:
there is only live presence. This show of not showing, this 'aesthetics
of the impossible' as Darwin Ortiz calls it,[^05chapter4_16] rests on partial,
willful masking of basic elements of the mediation. Even as it reveals
itself, the specific mediation of the magic show eludes the spectator.

Continuing the comparison, we can say that, in the high-wire act, the
mediation is intransitive, immediate and transparent, since we see
everything there is to see. Or at least that is how we experience it. In
the magic show, the mediation is more subtle and complex: we can see
that we don't see, which is why we cannot speak of opacity in this case,
for in a magic show as in any show, we cannot see nothing. If there is
neither opacity nor transparency, as we are not within a
representational logic, what are we dealing with? We are dealing with an
opacity that is not opaque and which, paradoxically, lets us see that we
don't see. The process that unfolds in the magic show might be called
'inopaque'. Inopacity is, in a way, the operative concept in the
aesthetics of the impossible which Ortiz refers to.

The concept of radical mediation is of considerable heuristic value.
Situating immediacy within mediation itself, as Grusin suggests, rather
than in the product of the mediation, is a major historical departure.
If mediation consists in endowing objects in the world with an
anthropomorphic aspect by re-presenting them, radical mediation
establishes a different, more direct or immediate relationship with the
world, which could be called formless since it does not rest on form.

It is unfortunate, however, that Grusin has exchanged one indissoluble
pair (transparent immediacy) for another (the immediacy of mediation),
thereby excluding the possibility of other combinations. While it was
necessary to situate mediation within a wider logic than that of
representation, the persistence of the representational mode of
mediation in all its forms, particularly in the arts and performance, is
something that we must accommodate for.

## Mediation as Excommunication

Alexander R. Galloway was one of the fiercest critics of Bolter and
Grusin's remediation model and a prolific proponent of abandoning the
concept of medium in favor of mediation. Today, the majority of
intermedialists subscribe to his formula: 'not media, but mediation'. In
2014, he published *Excommunication: Three Inquiries in Media and
Mediation*, co-authored with two other New York media theoreticians,
Eugene Thacker and McKenzie Wark. The book opens with an apparently
innocuous question that directly echoes Bataille's reflections: 'Does
everything that exists, exist to be presented and represented, to be
mediated and remediated, to be communicated and translated?'[^05chapter4_17] A
series of examples from various spheres leads them quickly and
predictably to answer in the negative, which raises a second question:
how, then, do we know that something exists? And a third: how can
something still be transmitted; in other words, how is it that something
is mediated?

Rehashing their argument in detail would be irrelevant here, but it
unquestionably represents another significant advance in intermedial
thinking about mediation and effects a major paradigm shift: while
Grusin has released mediation from the representational cage to which he
and Bolter had confined it, he still keeps it penned within the
perimeter of communication – a larger enclosure, to be sure, but an
enclosure nonetheless. Galloway and his co-authors go further by
proposing to remove mediation from the communicative framework. Just as
Grusin showed that the representational schema is only one remediation
model among many, Galloway et al. suggest that communication is only one
mode of mediation; it is neither the principle nor the matrix of
mediation: 'We aim, therefore, to craft not so much a theory of
mediation in terms of communication, for which there already exist a
number of exemplars, but a theory of mediation as excommunication'.[^05chapter4_18]

What, then, is this 'mediation as excommunication' that operates outside
communication, *i.e.*, outside strictly human communication (as it has
been conceived until now), and that encompasses the human and non-human
without distinction? It is 'a double movement in which the
communicational imperative is expressed, and expressed as the
impossibility of communication'.[^05chapter4_19] What they are referring to is not
the absence of a message or an interrupted communication; neither is it
a performative failure of mediation, since something, they insist, is
still being mediated. We don't know what, but we sense it, just as, in a
magic show, we see that we don't see, without (theoretically) knowing
what it is we're not seeing.

What the three authors of *Excommunication* are trying to articulate
corresponds, in many respects, to Bataille's project. As we know, media
theory originally revolved around what was thought to be a universal
communicative process, the best-known model being Shannon and Weaver's
classic scheme.[^05chapter4_20] Their 1948 model is based on a one-way, linear,
structural conception of communication. It breaks down (we would say
'discretizes') processes into sequences, including encoding and
decoding, and the agents, human and non-human, who perform them. The
model follows the 'message' through successive stages, from the
'information source' and the 'sender' to the 'receiver'.

The proposal Galloway and his colleagues make does not overcome the
difficulty Bataille encountered in defining the formless and modeling
its dynamics. This does not, however, vitiate its value, for it in fact
unveils a new stage in debates about intermediality and mediation. Just
as we can regard mediation as excommunication – that is, understand it
outside the communicative framework – we can speak of excommunicating
mediating conjunctures – *i.e.*, instances of mediation that are located
outside the classic model and hence cannot be explained by it. Thacker
calls these types of mediation 'Dark Media'. It might be suggested that
the magic show, with its 'inopacity', is a salient example. The function
of what might be called 'dark mediating conjunctures', which rub
shoulders with more traditional mediating conjunctures, no longer aims
to make the inaccessible accessible or to connect what is separate:
'Instead, media reveal inaccessibility in and of itself – they make
accessible the inaccessible – in its inaccessibility'.[^05chapter4_21]

## Conclusion

Georges Bataille forcefully defended the idea of a pervasive
formlessness from which humans have cut themselves off by the very means
they use to mediate it. They seek other paths, but find none to this
formlessness untouched by any discretization, for they remain imprisoned
in a logocentric logic. What they glimpse remains within the realm of
communication and can be expressed and transmitted only by their means.

The slow process of maturation that led Richard Grusin to a 'radical'
form of mediation is the most important change in the theory of
remediation to date. Breaking with the deep-rooted and widespread notion
that the function of media, like that of the arts, is to 'represent', an
idea that undergirds the remediation model, Grusin abandons the
representational paradigm and casts mediation as experience in the first
instance. In this case, what counts is the immediate, the mediation, not
its product.

Excommunication is the most recent development in thinking about
mediation: communication is one form of mediation but not the only one,
nor the most effective. Grusin has emancipated the varieties of
mediation from the confines of representation; Galloway, Thacker and
Wark have situated them beyond the limits of communication, in the
region where Georges Bataille sought the formless.

Conceiving of mediating conjunctures as other than representational
practices that translate the world into human language, accepting the
inaccessible in its inaccessibility and experiencing it as such,
constitutes a decisive double break in the development of what we call
postmediatic intermediality, and describes a new way of being in the
world and living together in and with the world.

# The Digital and Theater as Mediating Conjunctures

In this final chapter, we would like to show how intermedial thought, as
we conceive of it, is able to renew our approach to certain questions
which are, or have been, at the heart of important debates in various
research fields. We limit this study to two examples which seem to us
particularly significant for our study. Firstly, we will focus on the
digital in order to show how intermediality can help us to better
understand this reality, its nature and its conjunctures. We will then
reorient the discussion toward theater, a site of revaluation and major
reforms throughout the Long 20th century (from 1880 to today). We will
therefore focus on two concepts that have occupied, and continue to
occupy, a considerable place in theatrical reflection: presence and
theatricality.

## The Digital as Mediating Conjunctures

### The Digital does not Exist

The word 'digital' has invaded the public sphere for about twenty years.
We use it in everyday language, we talk about it a great deal in the
media; for institutions – governments, universities, businesses – it is
as a key word. The word had first been used as an adjective: 'digital
document', 'digital communities', 'digital identities', 'digital
economy', 'digital environment' \[...\] up until 'digital culture'. More
recently, it has become a substantive: it is referred to as 'the
digital' and even an 'object of analysis'.[^06chapter5_1] Enthusiasm for the
digital has otherwise contributed to the renewal of Media Theory: the
emergence of what could be called the 'digital turn' has shaped, in all
disciplines, a new and general interest in theoretical questions that
have, until now, seemed confined to the fields of Information Sciences
or Communication Sciences. The emergence of discourse relating to the
digital has been accompanied by the reappearance of a rhetoric on
revolution, a rhetoric that is by no means unprecedented nor exclusively
tied to the digital turn, as we will see.

In the following pages, we would like to analyze the digital with the
theoretical tools offered in this book. This exercise will allow us to
simultaneously test the operational value of the various concepts that
we have developed, understand the context that they have emerged from
and provide an interpretation of a discourse and a series of practices
that characterize our time. All of us are, indeed, buried in 'digital
culture',[^06chapter5_2] and the changes we reference with this expression are
among the reasons that justify the theoretical need for this book.

From the emergence of the term, which was related to technology and its
explosive use in the 1990s, we have envisaged the digital in many ways,
but each kind of discourse on this subject can be considered an attempt
at a discretization that aims to institutionalize not yet adopted
practices. In other terms, the digital is nothing other than the name by
which we try to naturalize practices whose characteristics are not
sufficiently clear to avoid entering into other adopted institutional
categories. We can assert that there is not, even today, a discourse on
the digital that is stable enough to consider it as a point of
reference. Many, sometimes contradictory, parallel debates circulate in
public space, none of which seem to generally converge in order to
overtake others and thereby emerge as institutional discourse. It would
otherwise be impossible – precisely because of the instability and the
non-institutionalized nature of these debates – to analyze them, or even
further, to simply establish an exhaustive list.

We will here take into account three ways of describing the digital that
seem to us the most present and therefore the most pertinent for
analytical purposes: the digital as a parallel space – the debate
surrounding virtual reality –, as a medium or an ensemble of media – the
debate on the age of communication – and lastly as an ensemble of
revolutionary devices – the debate on 'New Technologies'. These three
approaches do not really correspond to modes of critical or scholarly
analysis, but they represent rather the collective imaginary surrounding
the digital, the way of understanding this phenomenon which is
particularly visible in mediatic and commercial discourse and which has
a considerable impact on the general perception of technological
changes.

### The Digital as a Parallel Space

One of the debates on the digital turn includes that which tends to
identify the emergence of a space parallel to our primary space, a space
determined by different rules and that, often, competes with this
primary space.

Offering a historical record of this debate is a particularly delicate
task because, evidently, it does not constitute an unprecedented
*topos*: it had been present on numerous occasions throughout the
history of thought, and not only in the last century. Indeed, we can
recover this debate on a parallel and unreal space in the case of
television – as with Baudrillard[^06chapter5_3], for example, or with Popper[^06chapter5_4] –
but also that of the knighthood novels of the 17th century – that we see
for example in *Don Quixote*. But we could also go much further in
retracing the history of this *topos* from the myth of Plato's Cave, a
myth that presents exactly the same logical structure: many parallel
spaces whose degrees of reality are different, yet difficult to
identify.

We know, therefore, that his debate does not apply purely to the
digital, as it constitutes rather a reactualized *topos* enabling us to
understand particular practices. More precisely, we can say that this
debate asserts itself in relation to the digital in the 1980s, with the
appearance of the expression 'virtual reality'. Many texts have already
traced this history,[^06chapter5_5] which we will very briefly summarize here.
Virtual reality is a modelled, immersive and interactive space produced
with the help of a machine. The idea is that, thanks to computers, we
can produce a parallel reality that is completely artificial and
completely 'realistic'. This idea is more an imaginary space rather than
a technical reality: indeed, this concept has considerably developed in
science fiction tales, in literature – Gibson's *Neuromancer*, for
example – and even more so in cinema – from *The Matrix* to *Existenz*.
Even if the technical possibilities for materializing this fantasy
continue to develop and if the notion of virtual reality takes on a
fundamental importance in industry discourse, notably since Oculus
Rift's commercialization in 2016, this concept does not allow us to
sufficiently describe the digital turn. We could say that if, in the
1980s with the invention of the concept of virtual reality by Jaron
Lanier, this model seems to need to be the dominant model in computer
science development, today it is clear that virtual reality concerns a
very limited number of experiences among the multitude of information
technology uses.

The parallel world *topos* is promising and interesting when we analyze
its recreational or fictional use. It was, in fact, what Janet Murray
observed even in the 1990s with her book *Hamlet on the Holodeck*.[^06chapter5_6]
But this notion becomes insufficient and problematic in understanding a
series of practices that are in no way fictional, nor recreational, and
that take on a large importance in our daily use of digital tools. In
other terms: in the 1980s and 1990s, one would have thought that
recreational use would constitute a privileged use of emerging digital
tools. As practices have developed, we have realized that gaming is only
one of many possibilities relating to these tools, and probably not the
most interesting.

Taking the place of the debate on parallel, virtual, fictive, fluid and
navigable space – a series of terms tied to parallel space –, arises a
debate on concrete, hybrid and inhabitable space. The digital is always
considered a space, but a space that integrates with non-digital space
by blurring the difference between physical and non-physical which
characterize the first debate, as well as the one relating to the
fictive and non-fictive. We can here notice an initial phase of
naturalization: the notion of discontinuity, which would characterize
virtual reality rhetoric, is replaced by that of continuity. The digital
turn appears to be not so much a revolution, but rather something
natural that has always been a part of social practices.

### The Digital as Medium

Another way of envisioning the digital turn has been to think about all
tools – or even groups of tools – as a medium or as an ensemble of
media. This debate is very complex and differentiated, as well as
difficult to convincingly summarize, but we can try to understand it
starting with its most extreme formulation, which consists in speaking
of a digital medium as though an ensemble of technologies were united to
give way to a very powerful medium that would become the only device of
any mediation form. This is the idea behind Jenkins' *Black Box*.[^06chapter5_7]

This approach is tied to a series of debates that have developed, since
the 1960s, in the field of Media Studies and in the field of Information
and Communication Sciences. From this point of view, one tends to think
of media as devices enabling communication between two poles – whether
these poles be either living beings, machines or even conceptual
structures. One therein develops models to define the communication
process – as an exchange of information between two poles – and one
tries to understand media as an in-between that, at the same time,
renders possible and structures the communication. This debate is often
accompanied by the principle of transparency and immediacy – and remains
closely tied to a representational regime. One presupposes that there
would be an 'ideal' communication wherein there would be no 'information
loss' and that therefore there would be a perfect medium which is
completely 'transparent'.

We have seen the different problems that arise with this approach and
the different ways of perfecting this debate to avoid such downfalls. It
is the history of the intermedial mediatic period, with its
essentializing biases, that are increasingly overrun by theories that
attempt to free the representational paradigm's exclusiveness and the
polarities that it presupposes.

To think the digital turn in terms of media poses a large number of
problems and it is probably these problems that have contributed to the
changes relating to theories on media. This is what we have seen with
the different intermedial postmediatic approaches and in particular with
the critique of the communication paradigm developed in
*Excommunication*.[^06chapter5_8] Indeed, the very notion of communication is
tested in the digital context because, unless we accept an extremely
wide definition of communication, it becomes impossible to think in
terms of communication about phenomena, such as the algorithmic
gathering and analysis of private information for the purposes of
profiling, algorithmic organization of content as in the case of a
search engine or the use of cartographic tools to find a restaurant.

### 'New' Technologies

Rhetoric relating to novelty does not, in reality, constitute an
isolated and independent debate. It is more a general way of envisaging
the digital, a way that also affects the two other debates mentioned
here and that, in addition, is used to refer to many non-standard
practices well beyond the digital turn. It is a debate that tends to
identify elements that break with a hypothetical 'tradition'. Applied to
the digital, this debate is based on the key notion of 'new
technologies', whose paradox is easy to guess. Novelty can only be an
ephemeral quality and can therefore not be acknowledged on a
definitional basis. The adjective 'new' is therefore unrelated to the
thing that it would like to characterize. Every technology has been
'new' during a certain historical moment within a certain community – as
provocatively stated by the title of Carolyn Marvin's book *When Old
Technologies Were New*.[^06chapter5_9] Naming a technology as 'new', on the one
hand, emphasizes a presupposed break between this technology and the
preceding one and, on the other hand, labels all that came before this
novelty as obsolete, participating in a somewhat teleological discourse
(which is a very good – and very easy – sale argument for businesses).

Regarding the notion of a presupposed break: the idea of novelty refers,
from a theoretical point of view, to the possibility of clearly and
cleanly separating one chronological moment from another. This exercise
is obviously always characterized by an arbitrary aspect, as the caesura
between two chronological moments – as far as it can be justified – is
never without ambiguity and is, to an even lesser extent, based on
consensus. The difficulty for historians to delineate historical periods
serves as proof of this. In addition, the argument of novelty becomes
weak when we consider the fact that it has been widely used for more
than a century: in the field of media for the telephone, the radio,[^06chapter5_10]
etc., and in art, for example the avant-garde.

The notion of novelty has become an omnipresent *topos* in commercial
discourse that serves to establish the rapid obsolescence of products,
pushing users to buy the 'new' version of the same object as soon as it
is available. If we rely in part on analyses of this discourse, novelty
is very often identified by two elements indicating 'progress': speed
and simplicity. Novelty is, in other words, always understood in
commercial discourse as an advancing of a teleological process that
moves toward dreamlike perfection consisting in a technological device's
complete transparency. It is transparency that we criticize in this
book. The products are labelled with higher numbers indicating better
versions (iPhone 5, 6, 7, for example) and each version 'exceeds' the
preceding version often by improving the speed and offering increased
simplicity.

This ideology is clearly justified by the necessity to sell 'new'
products: it is, however, equally necessary to distance ourselves from
it if we hope to gain a theoretical understanding of the digital turn.

### Modern, Contemporary... Digital

The debate on novelty allows us to better identify the origin of the
need to make such common use of the word 'digital'. We maintain the
theory that this word does not derive from a real revolutionary change
that presents itself as a veritable chronological break – that it be
produced with the arrival of the web in the 1990s or prior. No break
disrupts temporal or historical linearity. Our history is continuous, it
is its institutions that discretely alter it. In other terms, our
practices change in time, and we modify our customs, our technologies,
our way of relating to the world. And this change is continuous. It must
also not be considered an evolution, as it does not move toward
'progress'; it is not teleological. Quite simply, our practices change.
The institution standardizes practices because they are based on a state
of things at a given moment. From the moment the institution
crystallizes its standards, practices continue to change, until the
moment that the institutions can no longer standardize them, as these
practices have become too different. It is at this moment that the
institution must change. And this change is done immediately – with a
change of standards that can only be discrete. It is at this moment that
we invent new words to describe the change. And it is at this moment
that we begin to refer to revolution. There is therefore revolution – or
at least a discrete and important change –, but of the institution and
not of the practices.

Let us consider some examples. The institutional devices that
standardize editorial practices were put in place during the 18th
century.[^06chapter5_11] It is interesting to note that more than two centuries
separate Gutenberg's invention of the creation of institutions. It is in
the 18^th^ century that copyright was put in place, that practices were
standardized, that editing became a framed practice.[^06chapter5_12] Publishing
companies became institutions. The states created laws to regulate these
practices. The institutions enabled standardization and gave meaning to
these practices – but also gave them a name. And yet, since the 18th
century, these practices have progressively changed. The meaning given
to words has changed, the importance attributed to the author has
changed – for example in the 1960s[^06chapter5_13] – techniques have changed, as
have readership, the number of literate readers, economic and social
conditions, etc. These changes create unease from within the
institution, as these norms no longer correspond to the realities of
these practices: practices distance themselves more and more from the
way the institution represents and regulates them. It is at this moment
that crisis unfolds and the need for institutional change emerges. The
symptom of this crisis and of this need for change is the word digital,
with which we name the disparity between real practices and those
practices that are standardized by the institution. In this sense, the
expression 'digital editing' names all the continuous changes that
separate 18th century editing from today's editorial practices. With the
expression 'digital editing', institutions try to take further stock of
the state of practices in order to be capable of once again
standardizing them so as to continue to manage them. We are living a
moment of institutionalization.

This same debate applies to a large number of institutions: if we think
of personal identity management, of teaching, of research, of art, of
communication. In the case, for example, of creating university
positions in 'digital literature', we witness a change in practices that
require the creation of this label. We speak of 'literature' to refer to
a certain number of practices that have crystallized over years and
centuries. These practices evolve up until a time where the difference
between what we mean by literature and what real practices are becomes
too important to not pose a problem. The university does not know what
to do with practices that do not enter into the institutional framework:
they therefore begin to use the word 'digital'. In this sense, the
digital has nothing – or very little – to do with computers. It may be
revealed that information technology has played a role in the change of
our practices, but this is not the primary role, and above all not the
only one. This is why, in the end, digital literature does not refer to
literature made by computers, but rather literature during the
historical moment of computers. The expression 'digital literature'
could be replaced by 'today's literature'. These are, in other words,
practices that probably relate to literature but that diverge too much
from institutionalized practices for us to simply consider them
'contemporary literature'.

And yet this brings up a series of questions relating to the
standardization process of practices, on the role of institutions, on
their place in society. Institutions are, by nature, always behind the
times. Their standardization is based on something that is always, by
definition, outdated. Practices are always beyond foundational
standards, they are always laden with an institutionalizing character
that is creative and normative. Each time someone creates literature,
they do something that is not really what we mean by literature but that
redefines the meaning of 'literature'. And this creativity undermines
institutional standards. Each time, the institution tries to catch up by
changing. This change is what we can call 'institutionalization' or
'standardization' our even 'naturalization', as we have seen in the
previous chapter. In the case of digital literature, for example,
institutionalization consists in creating prizes for 'digital
literature', classes, associations, editors that make 'digital
literature' and so forth (we could also refer to the work done for a
number of years by the *Electronic Literature Organization*). This
institutionalization implies that new practices no longer seem foreign
and deviant. They become normal. This also implies that norms are
appearing. We begin to know what 'digital literature' is and therefore
what it 'should' be. Prior to being institutionalized, alternative
practices were by no means standard: they were simply practices that did
not conform to institutional definitions. But after
institutionalization, they begin to be standardized, regulated: we know
what we must do if we want to reclaim the sector. This implies that
creative and innovative practices will end up by moving away from a
given definition and will again find themselves marginal to the
institution.

The standardization phase is, of course, necessary for being able to
organize our society. And yet, there are two ways of standardizing
practices: one is diachronic and the other synchronous. This means that
we can try to standardize a very limited number of practices over a very
long period (diachronic) or a very high number of practices over a very
short period (synchronous). Let us think about the definition of
practices that we assemble under the name of theater. We observe that
human beings in many societies and for many centuries do something
particular and very specific: they display their actions. We notice that
very often this display of actions is done within a pre-defined setting,
we notice the social role of this display of actions and the ensemble of
(technical, cultural, anthropological) devices that structure these
practices. All of this, we call 'theater'. With this word, we also try
to define what the theater is; we try to structure it. We try to
understand it and to standardize it so that we may manage its role in
society. It is based on this institutionalization that we can create
theaters, systems to subsidize theater productions, theater teaching
programs, and so forth. The same reasoning applies to literature,
cinema, television, radio. These are diachronic definitions of very
precise practices. Obviously, institutionalization provides a snapshot:
it disregards the differences between a heterogenous ensemble of
practices in order to place them in the same group and name them. One
could provide a degree of tolerance regarding the more or less important
differences in order to assemble a more or less elevated number of
practices (for example, by saying 'cultural activities', we group
'literary', 'theatrical', 'cinematographic' practices, etc.).

Synchronous institutionalization consists in taking a very heightened
number of practices relating to a very short time frame. In this way, we
very often refer to what is known as 'culture', for example the culture
of a period. Humanism, as a culture that characterizes the 15th and
16th centuries, assembles a series of very heterogenous practices that
are nonetheless characterized by a common denominator, a kind of 'spirit
of times'. We could say that religious cultures also enter into this
type of institutionalization even if, in the case of religion, we group
together a synchronous vision and a diachronic vision. But from a
certain viewpoint, we could assert that it is important is to first
standardize a very heightened number of practices in the present moment.
What counts is that all of today's Christians behave in the same way in
a determined situation. The fact that a hundred years ago things were
different does not count for much. Of course, the daily actions of a
Christian from a hundred years ago were very different from the actions
of a Christian today, simply because the changing environment, social
concerns, etc., were not the same. But the fact of being Christian today
alters the ensemble of possible practices (one is Christian when one
eats, when one makes art, when one works, etc.).

The digital tends to function in the same way – it is Milad Doueihi's
central theory in his book *Digital Cultures*,[^06chapter5_14] wherein the author
rightly makes comparisons between the digital and religion. With the
word 'digital', we define a very heterogenous ensemble of practices
that, as its common denominator, takes place in our present historical
moment. In using this word, we tend to converge all these practices,
even if they are very different: posting a photo on Facebook or writing
a scholarly article, purchasing an airplane ticket to go on vacation or
live-tweeting during a rock concert... This convergence can be seen as a
characteristic of contemporary culture. This is true and false at the
same time. It is true from an institutional point of view: discourse on
the digital tends to understand a very heterogeneous ensemble of
practices as a unit, and it thereby converges them. In institutional
discourse, a 'digital' expert will be consulted in relation to
purchasing strategies for Google servers, just as he would be for
psychological problems arising among adolescents using Facebook, or for
the latest Houellebecq novel in which the author plagiarizes Wikipedia.
What is derived from many different disciplines today converges into one
realm: the digital.

In reality, the practices themselves converge today no more than they
would have converged one hundred or two million years ago. It is just
our way of naming and understanding them from an institutional point of
view that has changed.

This specification can be understood in an essentialist way: there
exists a certain number of practices whose essence is to belong to the
same group. For example, 'digital' practices or 'theatrical' practices.
But this specification could otherwise be understood in a dynamic way:
it is precisely what we propose with the notion 'mediating
conjunctures'.

### The Digital as Mediating Conjunctures

If the word digital allows us to *synchronously* unite very heterogenous
practices, and if this group indeed serves to highlight the divergence
of current practices in relation to the ensemble of institutionalized
practices, it should be possible to identify – even in a non-exhaustive
way – the reoccurring features of these actions in order to extricate
the 'mediating conjunctures' that are the foundation of this digital
turn. In other terms, it should be possible to identify a series of
forces, tendencies, values, ideas, agents that dynamically interlace to
give way to current conjunctures that we adopt into common usage with
the label 'digital'.

It is necessary to again return to the arbitrary character of this
operation of identification. As we have said, mediating conjunctures are
always plural and multiple, and every act aiming to identify them
involves an arbitrary aspect. Nevertheless, we can better grasp this
common discourse by specifying the forces and the tendencies that seem
to be present in the current context to give way to this idea of digital
culture that Milad Doueihi refers to.

We propose to focus our attention on four aspects of the digital which
seem to us particularly pertinent: the notion of a network, the notion
of performativity, the notion of non-linearity and lastly the idea of
the mathematization of the world.

#### Network Culture

The word 'digital' is strongly associated with the development first of
the internet and then of the web. Digital culture is undoubtedly a
network culture, as we can see by the large number of scholarly works
dedicated to the subject.[^06chapter5_15] Ideas such as contribution, sharing,
connectivity, collaboration, etc., which are so present in today's
culture, bring into question many institutional gains – tied to the idea
of originality, for example, or of the individual, or again of the
author – that are founded on a network structure which seems to us
increasingly present. Clearly, this large presence of networks and the
impact that these structures have on our societies are not the only
features of the digital world. In other words, the digital is without a
doubt a network culture, but it is not the only one, nor the first. The
strength and omnipresence of the network are some of the digital turn's
particularities, the tendencies in play in the mediating conjunctures
that we call 'digital', but they are not a revolutionary element nor in
themselves unprecedented. Retracing the history of network culture would
be impossible, as it has crossed our societies' entire history as we
remember, for example, the road networks put in place by the Romans – a
centralized network, of course, but one that aimed to facilitate the
possibility of decentralization, a possibility on which the empire was
thereafter founded. We could cite other situations where the idea of a
network has played a fundamental role: the constitution of the posting
network from the Middle Ages, *Canal mania* and then *Railway mania* in
18th and 19th century England... Network culture has therefore developed
for millennia and their technical, economic and cultural capabilities,
as well as their interpretative and symbolic capabilities relating to
the network's consequences, which acquire over time, are present during
the development of informational networks, the Internet being the latest
example. In other terms, the notion of the network has always existed,
even if it were able to have a differing influence over the centuries.
Digital mediating conjunctures renew this notion, but they are far from
inventing it *ex nihilo*. In addition, understanding this long history
of network culture is necessary for correctly analyzing the debates
surrounding current technologies: informational networks have benefited
from the infrastructures that have previously been created for other
networks: notably the telegraph and railways. Optical fibre, for
example, crossed the United States following the railway, as railway
societies are the only ones to have been given permission to bury a
cable across the entire width of a country in avoiding telecommunication
societies by needing to ask permission from millions of different land
owners. Therefore, the geopolitical issues tied to the construction of
east-west railways in the 19th century have an impact today on Internet
geopolitics.[^06chapter5_16]

#### The Idea of Performativity

Another characteristic of the digital, or even, another force in play in
the establishment of the mediating conjunctures that we call 'digital',
leads us to the timeless opposition between two paradigms relating to
our interpretation of reality: a representational paradigm and a
performative – or if preferred, operational – paradigm. To put it
simply, we can think about writing practices just as we think of forms
of representations of the real, that is, a way to form a relationship
between a signifier – writing – and a referent – the real, to which
writing refers to. In this sense, we can think about writing as having a
mimetic function and insert it into the series of representational
forms, such as have been practiced and analyzed since Antiquity – from
Plato to today. Within this context, the question to be asked would
relate to the way linguistic acts correspond to their referents or,
otherwise stated, the relationship between truth and fiction: is writing
a faithful representation of the real or is it a fiction, such as the
novel?

And yet digital culture does not seem to privilege this paradigm and
instead suggests another: the performative paradigm. We have studied the
notion of performativity, and the effervescence around this term shows
that this paradigm acquires an importance more and more central to the
way we think the world.[^06chapter5_17]

To briefly explain, we could say that according to the performative
paradigm, writing must be considered as an act producing the real. In
other words, it is not a case of representing a reality, but of
constructing it. Digital culture privileges this approach. When we write
something on the web – and here we imply, by writing, all forms that
produce a trace, and therefore also the fact of publishing a photo – we
do so with an operational aim. We do not represent something, but rather
we do something – on the web I buy plane tickets, I organize my bank
account, I work, I buy a book, etc. Even when I write a review for a
restaurant on Tripadvisor, I do this so I can do something: for example,
to change the ranking of the restaurant in question or its visibility.
In fact, I am in the process of producing the restaurant, of
contributing to what this restaurant is – for example, a good or a bad
restaurant, a fish or a meat restaurant.

And yet, once again, it is easy to demonstrate that this tendency to
privilege the performative paradigm, as a characteristic of our digital
culture, was not recently invented. The two paradigms have always
existed and the importance of one or the other, as well as their
prevalence among common receptiveness, have not ceased to vary over the
course of history, as we see in the differing conceptions of mimesis
between Aristotle and Plato. For the former, mimesis has an exclusively
representative function. For the latter, it functions as a structuring
of the real. The mediating conjunctures that we crystallize using the
word digital are, in fact, characterized by a pre-eminence of the
performative paradigm, but this pre-eminence is only one of the forces
in play in current mediating conjunctures.

#### Non-Linearity

Non-linearity is among the characteristic tendencies of the digital, as
it, too, was obviously not born alongside the development of information
technologies. The example of the Alexandrine manuscripts is particularly
illuminating in this regard. It is enough to cast a quick look at a
manuscript such as the *Palatine Anthology* to realize this. This is a
10th century codex containing a collection of Greek epigrams. The
manuscript is particularly meaningful because, thanks to it, we have
access to a large part of the Greek poetry that we know today: the
manuscript is therefore of fundamental cultural importance.

Many characteristics of the manuscript seem interesting given our
current discussion: the fact that it is an anthology, the fact that it
is the result of the sedimentation of many textual layers – it contains
poems written between the 7th century BC to the 10th century AD, the
fact that it contains fragments and that it proposes different
non-linear classification systems. All these characteristics are
specific to digital writing. The idea of the anthology, which developed
during the Alexandrine age in the 3rd century BC, consists in composing
collections that are at the same time exhaustive – they give an overall
idea of a literary form or of particular themes – and partial – as it is
always the result of a selection. The *Palatine Anthology* is the
recompilation of ancient Alexandrine anthologies – in particular that of
Meleager. Obviously, the anthology implies a fragmentary form, and the
fragmentary form invites a non-linear structure. The question that
herein arises is as follows: how to produce a non-linear form in using a
paper support that is suited to linear writing? Compilers and copyists
have found many solutions to this challenge: one of them is the use of
scholia, which are comments in the margins that often create
relationships between the different fragments. The fragments are
organized in thematic order (the love epigrams, the death epigrams, the
religious epigrams, etc.) and the comments are placed in the margins to
identify the epigrams of the same author or those that speak of the same
person or the same city. In this way, the scholia offer a non-linear
organizational form. The *Palatine Anthology* seems to reveal the great
'desire' of the web to also characterize past centuries. Technological
developments are probably in part determined by this desire to orient
and structure them. We can try to retrace this penchant for
non-linearity by citing, for example, the ideas of Vannevar Bush, and
then of Ted Nelson, to make a link between a principle already present
in the 3rd century BC and the structuring of the web as conceived of in
the 1990s. The hyperlink, the layering of different versions, systematic
rewriting – plagiarism, pastiche, parody – have always existed and the
digital has only absorbed these culturally ancient tendencies.

#### Mathematization

Another tendency of 'digital' mediating conjunctures can be seen in the
more or less explicit dream that has haunted our minds for many
millennia. One sees it here and there in Egyptian lists, in Aristotelian
catalogues, in the mnemonic rules of Florentine Neoplatonists of the
Renaissance, in Leibniz's mathematical models, in the affirmations by
the big names of the web: the world is made up of an enormous mass of
information, the knowledge and cultivation of which could enable an
almost complete mastery. It would therefore be possible to know
everything, to foresee everything, to do everything. And there are two
purely human limitations that inhibit the retention and cultivation of
this entirety of information: accessibility and calculability.

Not all information is entirely accessible to humans, even if we
consider that information exists, that it lies somewhere – contained in
a book, retained by a group of specialists or simply observable in
nature – or that it is disseminated, hidden or even beyond
understanding, and this is because of an inability wherein we find
ourselves decoding and standardizing languages, coding, formats. The
structural problem of the library derives from this observation. The
library is a device that attempts to knock down one of two limits of the
dream of complete knowledge: accessibility. In a library, all the
information – or at least a lot of information – is accessible. But,
even if complete accessibility were achieved, one other limit would
remain: the concatenation of data, calculability. In other terms, once a
person has access to a large mass of information, how can they cultivate
it? Having access to millions of books, I can only make use of the
information that I am capable of reading and retaining. In order to
cultivate this information in its totality, the information would need
to make up an object calculable by a huge machine that would
automatically process them. The mathematization of sciences is an
attempt to resolve this second problem.

With the enthusiasm stirred by the development of the web, such a dream
was born and promised both complete accessibility as well as
calculability. The machine became a Leibnizian god, capable of knowing
all and calculating all and promising complete accessibility and
complete calculability which means complete knowledge. Tim Berners Lee
can be considered a public figure who promotes this dream of complete
knowledge. In a 2009 TED Talk,[^06chapter5_18] he presents this idea in an enthused
and enthusiastic manner. 'A few years ago, I asked you to put your
documents online and you did so. It's great! Today I ask you to put your
data on the web'. Accessibility and calculability. The web renders an
enormous mass of documents accessible. A question herein arises relating
to the cultivation of this data. A human cannot use this data because of
its size. But if this information becomes pure data, machines can
therefore understand and calculate it: complete knowledge is therefore
possible. 'Raw Data Now!' cries Tim Berners Lee. Raw data is a
formalization of the information that renders knowledge usable by a
machine. The analysis of data can take place thanks to the strength of
the computer's calculations. The data is pure, open to all possible
associations of meaning and a machine can tie it to an ensemble of other
data. The world can be known in a complete, absolute and objective way.

It is therefore evident that the idea of the mathematization of the
world, which is sometimes presented as a novelty of the digital age, has
traversed the history of thought.

### Conclusion

The ensemble of these ideas and tendencies combines today by giving way
to conjunctures whose singular and novel aspect is not found in each of
these ideas considered individually, but in their concentration in
shared space. It is the combination of these ideas – as well as a series
of others that may please us to identify and specify – within a
particular technological and economic context that gives way to the
digital turn. And yet, as we have highlighted, mediating conjunctures
are not stable and cannot be 'identified'. The gesture of identification
that we here propose is therefore necessarily arbitrary, as it consists
in isolating certain characteristics in relation to others, and to
purposefully 'isolate' our observational range. As in the case of a
school of fish, we can limit our gaze to what occurs within the
geometric shape of the school, or we can also see how it interacts with
one or many external elements. And again, we can choose a more or less
extended period of observation – synchronous or diachronic. In the same
way, the digital turn is a way of demarcating a field of observation
within our current society by prioritizing certain aspects. In reality,
behind this crystallization we find a moving ensemble of forces and
tendencies for which we can always retrace a continuous line of
development.

## Theater as Mediating Conjunctures

The theater offers an observational field so fertile for intermedial
studies that it is surprising that a delay of nearly twenty years
separates the emergence of the first intermedial concepts (in the middle
of the 1980s) and their application to dramatic and dramaturgic
practices (in the middle of the 2000s).[^06chapter5_19] theater, which has
witnessed remarkable mutations thanks to electricity, and which
experiences an important renewal attributable to the breaking down of
traditional disciplinary barriers and to the invasion of digital
technologies, can be considered, as Chiel Kattenbelt suggests, as the
ideal intermedial practice.[^06chapter5_20] It would therefore prove logical that
theater studies integrate central intermedial concepts into their
heuristic arsenal. As a dynamic and fertile practice where, since its
beginnings, arts and technologies cross and combine, and where the
concept of mediation is crucial, the theater finds itself in fact tied,
in one way or another, to all the great mediatic and technological
upheavals that have shaped the world of communications and entertainment
for over a century and that are at the heart of intermedial theory.

This surprisingly belated penetration is not the outcome of chance or of
random heuristic negligence, it is largely explained by what we have
called a 'mediatic resistance' occurring within the world of theater.
The intermedialists affirm the primacy of relationships over the objects
caught within the dynamic and the genesis of media practices and, above
all, they place at the center of their preoccupations the question of
materiality and the role of technology – the non-human. In doing so,
they have done little to draw sympathy from a community who, for more
than a century, have forged their identity based on the real-life actor
(their voice, their body) and their 'direct' relationship, reputed as
pure, true and natural, with another real-life person, the spectator. By
rejecting essence (including that of theater) and binary oppositions –
for example, the live versus the mediated – onto which dominant
theatrical discourse is constructed, intermediality calls into question
certain foundations of theater studies and invites us to redefine them.
But this meeting also concerns circumstantial factors. Intermedial
thinking was deployed at a moment when theater studies had hardly begun
to emerge as a separate (university) discipline. It was therefore vital,
in order for theater studies to assert its legitimacy, to distance
itself from literary studies, a discipline from which they sought to
free themselves.

We now approach two subjects, largely discussed within theater studies,
that illustrate the difficulty of understanding a stage-based and
dramaturgic practice in full bloom. The intermedial perspective that we
adopt allows us not only to measure the distance separating the stage's
reality from theoretical discourse, to grasp its inadequacy, but also to
identify some of its underlying causes. The notion of presence (and
liveness) and that of theatricality thereby reveal a profound crisis
which has not yet entirely subsided.

### Presence and its Founding Trio: Liveness, Ephemeral, Nowness

Jonathan Sterne,[^06chapter5_21] a figurehead of American Sound Studies, recalls
the slogan-concepts 'fidelity' and 'high-fidelity' that have been
hammered into the sound reproduction industry[^06chapter5_22] from the end of the
19^th^ century up until the end of the 20th century and that, relying on
mimetic logic, have no other objective than to frustrate the 'traitor'
accusations directed towards its 'devices', which disrupt the link
between the body of the artist and the ear of the listener. These
devices break the tie that its defenders claim as 'direct', 'pure',
'natural', 'unique' alongside, obviously, any other evocation of
nostalgia and anticipation of the future. Sound reproduction
technologies supposedly damage the *aura*[^06chapter5_23] of the artist and the
stage that had been, up until then, the only place of the consecration
of 'beautiful voices'. In addition to questions of reproduction and
authenticity that it gives rise to, the intrusion of 'mediated' sound –
that is to say, transmitted by microphones, loud speakers and
phonographs (records) – onto the theater stage was therefore perceived
and presented as a double assault, by detractors who were also the
defenders of the so-called 'secular' stage: the assault of the 'new
decadent culture' of mechanic entertainment against the 'other' culture
which is hundreds of years old; we refer to technology's assault against
the artist and against art, often reduced to that of the false against
the true. Not only did this reproduced sound establish an initial
historical break between the voice and the body,[^06chapter5_24] moving away from
what nature had connected, but it launched the 'unnatural' practice of
acousmatic listening.[^06chapter5_25]

This debate, which has left many still very tangible traces, in addition
to what we will cover here, aimed to preserve a 'live' relationship that
would be glorified for its essential, and transcendent value relating to
the concept of liveness,[^06chapter5_26] a value which, from the outset must, in
the spirit of its promoters, be situated at the hierarchical pinnacle of
representational practices 'seen in action' (as in cinema, records,
radio or television). Nobody today contests the fact that the theater is
effectively a practice above all branded by living presence – the
co-presence of actor and spectator – but the hierarchical conception of
practices that were attached to this argument rest on the existence of
stability and of the media frontiers that intermediality reduces to
discursive constructions. However, from an intermedial point of view,
the most important problem lies elsewhere: it derives from the
oppositions and amalgams which form the foundation of thought relating
to the concept of liveness. In defining this school of thought in
opposition to the mediated, one ends up considering the live and the
mediated as irreconcilable, destined to mutually exclude one another. As
for the amalgams, the effects were equally pernicious. Here we will
retain only that which has allowed a widening of the concept of liveness
to that of 'nowness', a process that irreducibly associates presence
with the ephemeral and confining it as such.

This discussion purports only to highlight and to valorize that which,
for more than two millennia, created essence and belonged to its
episteme. But these arguments fit, in a much more prosaic way, within
market-based principles. We therefore notice that, in Arthur Pougin's
monumental 1885 dictionary on theater and its associated arts, which is
among the first encyclopedic works on theater, presence is in no way
referenced. Pougin does, however, methodically examine the semantic
field of the word 'theater', from which he draws more than half a dozen
meanings. None of them deal with presence, be it in relation to the
actor or to the spectator. Pougin also dedicates a long and particularly
insightful paragraph to 'theater art', but again, without alluding to
the notion of presence.

> Here, a word whose significance is great, a word that represents and
> implies an ensemble of very diverse qualities, whose happy reunion
> only can enable the attainment of the entirely relative perfection
> allotted to human nature. Theater art is a particularly complex art,
> very varied in its expression as in its means, speaking at once to the
> spirit, the imagination, the ears and the eyes, and thereby producing
> impressions of a rare strength and a surprising intensity.[^06chapter5_27]

These 'very diverse qualities' and this 'particularly complex art, very
varied in its expression' grasps, without naming it, a theatrical
concept that we will later discuss. If, in this definition of theater
art, we see that it resonates with Richard Wagner's[^06chapter5_28] Total Artwork
project, the symbolists' *synesthesia dream*, or even Chiel Kattenbelt's
hypermedium model, we find not a minute trace of this notion of presence
so frequently evoked following the appearance of cinema!

The intermedial approach has demonstrated that there are ontological
issues tied to every technological innovation – or every intermedial
transfer (between an ensemble of mediating conjunctures and another) –
and that these concerns become major and therefore terribly worrying
when innovation has the ability to overturn usage protocols and
established values. The more anxiety thrives, the stronger the media
resistance that nourishes it becomes. This was the case during the
electrical era, and it remains perhaps even more so in our current
historical moment. Technologies founded on the digital are supple and
have a transformational potential clearly superior to that of electric
technologies. It is therefore unsurprising that the anxieties induced by
electric media are not only transferred, but amplified by essentializing
discourse.

### Presence and Reproduction

Pougin published his dictionary even while sound reproduction
technologies (telephone, microphone, phonograph) were still in their
infancy, when cinema was no more than a fantasy. But this is not the
case for Walter Benjamin's *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical
Reproduction*, published during the aforementioned period. He dedicates
a long passage to the theater, largely repeating the criticisms and
fears expressed by the playwright and director Luigi Pirandello
regarding cinema in his novel *Si gira*.[^06chapter5_29] Choosing a camera operator
as his protagonist, Pirandello demonstrates, in this work the little
consideration, if not contempt, that he has for this 'new
entertainment'. He therefore sees cinema as neither more nor less than
the end of the actor's art. The cinema as anti-theater!

> The film actor, wrote Pirandello, feels as if in exile – exiled not
> only from the stage but also from himself. With a vague sense of
> discomfort he feels inexplicable emptiness: his body loses its
> corporeality, it evaporates, it is deprived of reality, life, voice,
> and the noises caused by his moving about \[...\].[^06chapter5_30]

Or again,

> The artistic performance of a stage actor is definitely presented to
> the public by the actor in person; that of the screen actor, however,
> is presented by a camera \[...\].[^06chapter5_31]

The 'immediate' presence of the actor in relation to the spectator, and
their interaction, to which Pougin made no allusion forty years earlier,
therein emerges as THE distinctive quality of theater performance and
seems to guarantee its ontological superiority in regard to 'reproduced'
performances. The depreciative effect extends not only to electric
media, but to all forms of mediations realized with the help of
technological (or non-human) devices – be they acoustic or electric.

We could undoubtedly reproach Benjamin for having granted an overly
large space – an entire space, in fact – to Pirandello in the 1910s, the
years of silent film, and of preoccupying himself with the writer during
this period of his reflection on the *aura*, which concerns theater. We
know that Benjamin defended the idea of wider sharing and better
accessibility of artistic productions, if only at the cost of losing
their auratic quality. If Pirandello's opinion is particularly
interesting to us, it is because it indeed reflects a largely widespread
feeling in the theatrical milieu of the period. But this was neither a
unanimous point of view nor a progressive one. In the post-war days,
Gabriele D'Annunzio, Pirandello's great rival, as well as the futurists,
did not cease, on the contrary, to boast the virtue and potential of
cinema. In addition, Pirandello himself did not take too long to rally
to their side, performing a remarkable 'conversion',[^06chapter5_32] to borrow
Fabio Andreazza's ironic term.

This concept of theater's presence must in fact be understood as an
application of the *hic et nunc* principle of the work of art, developed
by Benjamin, to theatrical reality,[^06chapter5_33] a *hic et nunc* that creates
its own uniqueness: 'The presence of the original is the prerequisite to
the concept of authenticity'.[^06chapter5_34] In an era where competition between
other media drives theater to justify its very existence via a discourse
on identity[^06chapter5_35] that relies on its 'difference', the concern is simple:
every disparity in relation to this 'authenticity' must be perceived as
an impoverishment. In fact, the 'situations into which the product of
mechanical reproduction can be brought may not touch the actual work of
art, yet the quality of its presence is always depreciated'.[^06chapter5_36] It is
obviously unlikely that the defenders of theater's 'essence' had read
Benjamin and were inspired by the passages that he dedicated to
Pirandello. We should instead notice that these preoccupations were well
and truly circulating in this troubled time and that, for the defenders
of presence, art is human, and therefore all non-human intervention –
technology, as it happens – impoverishes it or, worse, betrays it. But
contrary to Benjamin, the defenders of theater's presence cling to a
dualist model, forgetting the advantages of reproduction that Benjamin
nonetheless highlights. They cling to this simplistic logic where the
'reproduced' – that which corresponds to the mediated – suffers an
unavoidable loss in relation to the original. They present theater
performance as one of the ultimate spaces of resistance to the
domination of mechanical reproduction. This theory sometimes seems
supported by Benjamin himself.

Any thorough study proves that there is indeed no greater contrast than
that of the stage play to a work of art that is completely subject to
or, like the film, founded in, mechanical reproduction.[^06chapter5_37]

Benjamin not only recognized theater's particular status at the hour of
its reproduction by technology, he highlighted the essential function
played by the actor. It is to the actor that theater owes its
originality, even its superiority. Quoting perceptual psychologist and
film theorist Rudolph Arnheim, Benjamin recalls that 'the latest trend
\[in film consists in\] treating the actor as a stage prop chosen for
its characteristics and \[...\] inserted at the proper place'.[^06chapter5_38]

Pirandello's complaint of the film cameras 'denaturing' interference is
the same that motivated accusations of sound reproduction technologies'
betrayal, as Jonathan Sterne mentions.

One could be tempted to believe that three quarters of a century later,
the reality of the practice – which was not undermined by the invasion
of reproduction technologies and intermedial transfers – would have
relegated this essentialist discourse, along with the notion of
presence, which it is based on, to the ranks of a historically
categorized argument. But it is far from that. In an important work
published in 1993, Peggy Phelan, a noteworthy figure in Performance
Studies, persistently recalls this feature that she presents as a
primordial ontological fact for theater.

> Only life is in the present. Performance cannot be saved, recorded,
> documented, or otherwise participate in the circulation of
> representations of representations: once it does so, it becomes
> something other than performance.

One cannot counter this statement: a recorded theater representation is
not the original representation. One is, however, less partial to the
ideology that underpins it and that Phelan renders more explicit when
she couples her declaration with a warning against all media
contamination of the stage, which is, once again, not unrelated to the
accusations of 'betrayal' evoked by Sterne, or the 'collapse' that
Pirandello denounces.

To the degree that performance attempts to enter the economy of
reproduction, it betrays and lessens the promise of its own
ontology.[^06chapter5_39]

Therefore, associating with 'the economy of reproduction' in the middle
of the 1990s while the digital wave unfolded, remained a betrayal of
theater's 'ontological promise!'.

Phelan's declaration would result in an aggressive reaction from Philip
Auslander[^06chapter5_40] and trigger a long and passionate debate within
Performance and Theater Studies. Auslander's foundational argument was
that, not only is presence not the opposite of the meditated, but it is
its product, a product which is, for that matter, not exclusive to
theater. Auslander's arguments were irrefutable and should have blown
away all resistance, but the conflict did not limit itself to rational
logic. Rather, it focused on a fundamental and hugely complex dimension:
identity.

In his essay on memory, history, and forgetting,[^06chapter5_41] published at
nearly the same time as Bolter and Grusin's work on remediation and as
Auslander's work on liveness, Paul Ricœur furthers his reflection on the
construction of identity and on related concerns initiated about ten
years prior.[^06chapter5_42] By returning to concepts such as 'sameness' and
'ipseity', the latter corresponding more to the defenders' arguments –
including Phelan – for maintaining the original purity of the practice,
Ricœur underlines the flaws relating to the process of affirming one's
identity and the downward spiral that this can cause. Identity is not
entirely certain! 'What constitutes the fragility of identity? It is
identity's purely presumptive, alleged, reputed character'.[^06chapter5_43] It is
in order to legitimize this presumption-allegation-assertion that the
defenders of identity – namely, of ipseity – recall with such insistence
a past that is quite obviously a reinterpreted one.

> The heart of the problem is the mobilization of memory in the service
> of the quest, the appeal, the demand for identity.
>
> \[...\]
>
> As the primary cause of the fragility of identity we must cite its
> difficult relation to time; this is a primary difficulty that,
> precisely justifies the recourse to memory as the temporal component
> of identity, in conjunction with the evaluation of the present and the
> projection of the future.[^06chapter5_44]

As a secondary cause of this fragility, Ricœur points to alterity, 'the
confrontation with others, felt to be a threat. It is a fact that the
other, because other, comes to be perceived as a danger for one's own
identity'.[^06chapter5_45] The other is, namely, as we have seen, the cinema and
other representational practices, but also that which, from these
practices, infiltrates the theater and breaks, in the eyes of some, its
'ontological promise'.

But this secondary reason manifests itself above all in the present,
whereas the former has an effect over time, both past and future: past
because we shape a historical narrative made to measure for this
identity, in erasing tendencies or major historical facts that alter it
and magnify more secondary ones that justify it; future because identity
is also an affirmation of the self, projected into the future to ensure
that the projection's effectiveness depends upon the archives that one
generation bequeaths to the one following. The archival gesture is not,
however, mechanical nor insignificant. It allows one document, rather
than another, to transcend time. Let us take two examples, one from the
past, one from the present.

The 20th century historical narrative has rendered theater the 'residue
of pure and authentic culture in a world of mass-media and television
daftness', as Peter Boenisch rightly claims.[^06chapter5_46] From Jacques Copeau's
'bare stage' and Peter Brook's 'empty space' to Jerzy Grotowski's 'poor
theater', the narrative insists heavily on minimalist practices. These
practices are often over-documented and over-commented in relation to
many other experiences which are, however, not lacking in interest nor
resonance in stage practice more generally. We highlight the case of the
remarkable collection for the *Association de la Régie Théâtrale*[^06chapter5_47]
uncovered by Françoise Pélisson-Karro.[^06chapter5_48] This fund includes a very
rich collection of manuscript notes detailing the direction of nearly
two thousand theater productions created in Paris between 1850 and 1950.
Interest in these documents is indisputable, as they demonstrate well
how the creators and producers of the period, in their large majority,
integrated technology, including sound and image reproduction
technology, into their show, without appearing distressed by ontological
concerns. And yet these precious archives failed to be lost, despite
being rejected by large institutions, including the National Library of
France (BnF). They wandered for years, only surviving thanks to the
dedication of some, before ending up at the *Bibliothèque Historique de
la Ville de Paris* where they were finally appreciated for their
cultural wealth.

We could believe that the opposition between presence and the mediated,
as well as its influence on the archival gesture, would progressively
ease at a time when the use of individual microphones (and the murmuring
voices that it enables) would nearly go unnoticed, where the recourse to
soundtracks and to videographic projections is clearly naturalized and
where certain noteworthy shows, nonetheless perceived as theater shows,
include no living actor on stage.[^06chapter5_49] While this huge entry into the
dreaded 'economy of representations of representations' does not seem a
problem for audiences, nor for practitioners, the opposition between
presence and the mediated persists. We truly perceive this within
theater schools who continue to focus their education on the direct
physical relationship between the stage and the room (rare are those who
ensure the mastery of a role with a mic, or before a camera) but, even
further, in the treatment of theater archives resulting in the direct
recording of the representation.

### The Archival Status of Sound and Audiovisual Recording

Certain archives seem 'natural' and possess a distinct value in virtue
of an authenticity regime which, we notice, also rests primarily on the
cult of presence. Theater texts, manuscript notes, photographs,
programs, posters, sometimes even elements of set design or costumes,
technical and administrative documents, correspondence between creative
participants, critical testimonies, all of these at first seem
archivable, and researchers generally have access to these documents
without too much difficulty. This is not the case for the direct sound
recordings of representations (by cassette or reel-to-reel recorder)
that began to be used in the 1950s, nor for direct video recordings that
became widespread in the 2000s (thanks to the progress and accessibility
of digital technology). Audio recordings are straight out neglected, the
majority of them poorly stored and currently inaudible. Very often, they
are simply discarded. More recent video recordings are difficult to
access. The reticence of theater companies and creative teams to make
them available is well known, especially when these recordings are not
the object of any post-production editing or filtering and are made with
the help of a single mounted camera.

For an intermedialist, the reticence to retain these archives, which
nevertheless brings us even closer to representation, is only explained
because these archives, as opposed to others, are the result of a
remediation of representation in its duration. They therefore weaken a
foundation of the concept of theater presence, and of its ontology. In
the wake of Peggy Phelan's striking essay, Gay McAuley thereby reminds
us that:

> Theatre, by its nature, is an art of the present moment, and the
> theatre artists focus on the present of the lived experience.
> Performance is unrepeatable and is fascinating to performers and
> audiences precisely because it is unique and ephemeral.[^06chapter5_50]

McAuley's declaration reminds us of another made by Malcolm Cowley in
1962, at the time of the first non-radiophonic and non-phonographic
audio recordings (namely magnetic recordings): 'The supremacy of the
theater derives from the fact that it is always now on the stage'.[^06chapter5_51]
This fusion of the ephemeral, uniqueness and non-repetitiveness
associated with the flagship concept of presence, not only goes against
the human 'desire to retain',[^06chapter5_52] but also defies all archival logic.
In this simplistic reasoning where presence is opposed to the mediated,
it is hard to conceive of the ephemeral other than in its immediacy,
therefore in its continual disappearance, further highlighting, once
again, the disconnect between discourse on theater and reality which
must, on the contrary, take into account the current moment as well as
the future. From there, the fall in favor of long-standing archives,
from there also the response of archivists clearly summarized by Matthew
Reason: 'if we do not document performance it disappears; we document
performance to stop it disappearing'.[^06chapter5_53] But no-one, aside from the
defenders of essentialist discourse, claims that the end of this
disappearance constitutes the persistence of performance.

We can assert, without huge risk of error, that propagators of thought
on presence have turned away, for ideological purposes, a characteristic
that theater shares with other practices. Instead of recognizing that
presence, even in theater's most reduced form, is always the product of
mediating conjunctures, they have raised this presence to the status of
an absolute, insisting on its rarity and its immediacy. It is difficult
to separate, in their long and complex action, that which comes from a
*technophobic* sentiment, religious convictions – and the belief in
natural (divine) superiority over the artificial (human) – from
commercialism, nostalgia, fear, blindness or simple naivety. But let us
dream for a moment: what remarkable and precious information could
provide us with a video recording of the creation of *Hamlet* in around
1600 or the *Imaginary Invalid* of 1673? What an experience of a
lifetime, what happiness! To what or to whom would this 'reproduction
economy' harm? Surely not the history of theater? Who would be betrayed?
No-one. And what would be betrayed? Nothing.

The steps taken these last years in different countries which attempt to
preserve these recordings and to render them recognized learning
materials shows that mentalities change and that the narrative of
auratic and unique presence is losing influence. From an intermedial
point of view, we can only rejoice.

### Crisis Symptoms: from Theatricality to Performativity to Theatrically

The chaotic emergence and evolution of the concept of theatricality give
us another occasion to test the intermedial approach in theater. In the
pages that follow, we do not offer a continuous history of this major
concept in theater studies, but we will concentrate on its transitional
moments that reveal intermedial dimensions. This perspective is
therefore slightly different from that which we have adopted in the case
of presence. Up until now, we have analyzed facts and a discourse in
relation to the intermedial grid. Here, we sketch an intermedial history
of theatricality.

As a composite practice in which human agents from different domains –
authors, scenographers, musicians, actors, sound creators, lighting
creators, performers, technicians, etc. – collaborate alongside
non-human agents of an equally diverse nature, the theater is
historically founded on the principle of mimesis – as are other arts,
such as in Western literature – that is to say on the principle of the
representation of a certain reality that is not exclusively limited to
the visible universe and to everything that inhabits or has inhabited
it, but to that which could have been, or should be. From Aristotle's
*Poetics* to Paul Ricœur's *Time and Narrative* (1983), or to the
cardinal rule of classical similitude, from the concern for the romantic
'true detail' to realist requirements and Stanislavki's 'reliving of an
experience' of the 19th and 20th centuries, we have not ceased to
redefine, to adapt, to draw out the concept of mimesis, all without
bringing into question the existence of the triad that founds it or the
invariable chronology of the mimetic action that requires, in this order
(1) a source – 'the original', (2) the action to imitate and (3) the
'copy' which is its outcome.

Ricœur, in centring his reflection on mimesis in historical as well as
fictional narrative, has in fact renewed and confirmed this more than
two-thousand-year-old conception: 'We therefore follow the destiny of a
prefigured time and a refigured time by the mediation of a configured
time'. The model that Ricœur develops does, however, merit underlining
the centrality of the action that he rightly describes as 'mediation'.
It is the constitutive triad of mimesis and the logical which binds
these elements that have progressively led to the concept of
theatricality. But associated notions of action or of mediation remind
us that mimesis is a dynamic process and that within it there is a
central dimension which is by nature performative.

We have insisted on the fact that, all while rejecting essentialism and
the idea of the existence of related irreducible invariables, we
recognize that mediating conjunctures are differentiated at once from
their nature and their effects. It is in this sense that we understand
theatricality: it is the mediality of theater, that is to say that
quality emerges from singular conjunctures that have the effect of
producing a theater show or its components in a given spatio-temporal
and cultural context. The processes, elements, conditions and agents
required for the theater show to take place vary from one period to
another, from one region to another, from one institutional framework to
another, from one culture to another. Theatricality continuously
evolves. And this relative instability gives rise to questions of an
ontological nature that challenge institutional discourse. In fact, this
instability has been and is translated again into a necessity where we
find ourselves continuously redefining theatricality and shifting the
boundaries between media practices.

Our inability to lastingly define genres or media – to be precise, we
are obliged to remain true to a defined conjuncture (5th century (BC)
Greek tragedy, the French theater of the *Grand Siècle*, American
vaudeville theater, etc.) – is the most striking display of this. And
technological progress derived from the mastery of electricity and, more
recently, from digital developments, have only accentuated and rendered
again more apparent this changing media reality that brings into light
the very porous frontiers (between media practices) or which, more
precisely, reveal their invented nature (frontiers are above all
discursive constructions). The audiences that attend the most recent
theater productions and dance shows in fact regularly experience this:
we find many more shared characteristics between these two reputed and
distinct art practices than between current theater and that of the 17th
century. Ontological discourse traces frontiers, suggests historical
filiations, deduces theoretical ties between practices of different
periods, that the stage reality enjoys interfering with.[^06chapter5_54]

If it is undeniable that the different elements which enter into what
constitutes theatricality vary, it is equally true that these defining
elements are not exclusive to theater practice. We must therefore
understand theatricality as a conjuncturing ensemble wherein not only
are none of its elements necessary and permanent, but not one of them is
exclusive to theater. The frontality principle associated with the
Italian stage, for example, is not unique to theater, as it also applies
to cinema, and to the magic lantern. In the same way, the concept of
presence, which Henri Gouhier has elevated to the 'essential' quality of
theater, also applies to dance, as we have just mentioned, as well as to
the circus and to concert performances, but also to sporting events
(when one attends in person). And this same concept of presence – or of
live – has paradoxically allowed radio and television to differentiate
themselves from cinema and to win popular favor.

We unsurprisingly notice that even the term theatricality, as well as
presence, only belatedly appeared. It began to be used at the beginning
of the 1950s. This does obviously not mean that the very idea of the
specificity of theater mediality did not exist prior, but that the
perception we had of the situation meant that it was not useful to name
it. Thomas Postlewait and Tracy C. Davis, who examined in detail the
emergence of the concept in their book *Theatricality*,[^06chapter5_55] thereby
note that this concept was progressively built outside of theater. In
intermedial terms, we would say that it is the remediation of certain
elements associated with theater by extra-theatrical practices that lead
to its opacification. In accordance with the principle of media
*transparency* theorized Bolter and Grusin, theatricality, to the
theater, was naturalized and passed unnoticed. It is not rendered opaque
and it therefore becomes apparent only in migrating outside of the
theater. Face to face with other forms of communicational and media
practices, theatricality becomes salient, that is, very audible and very
visible. Having thereby associated the theater with magnification, with
exaggeration, with masking, with padding, with lying that is 'with the
perverted, the artificial, the unnatural, the abnormal, the decadent,
the effete, the diseased',[^06chapter5_56] that which standard language understands
by 'making theater'; or when there is the addition of the epithet
'theatrical' to the substantives gesture, pose, attitude, situation, or
conclusion, etc.

The 'theatrical' – and through this the very idea of theatricality –
therefore rapidly acquires a negative connotation which, by
contamination, would extend to the theater itself. It would be separated
from, according to Postlewait and David, a profound 'anti-theatrical
prejudice' that undermines the very legitimacy of theater as a
representational art. At the end of the 19^th^ century, the arrival of
realism to the stage can therefore be understood as a desire to reaffirm
this legitimacy by putting an end to consistent opacifying of the
processes of theater mediation and by rendering them transparent. This
confirms that theatricality is tied to its historical period. We
otherwise notice that the arrival of stage realism corresponds, in time,
to a marked acceleration of research and of experimentation in the field
of sound and image reproduction, that would give birth to the large
electric media of the 20th century. In the mimetic logic that realist
theater defends, theatricality does not disappear, but its effect of
enlargement and of exaggeration diminishes to the benefit of a
'reliving' (of reality). The distance between the original and the
reproduced therein achieves its most reduced form possible, according to
the users of the period.

Bolter and Grusin remind us, however, that transparency is neither the
ultimate objective of mediation nor an inevitable and desired outcome,
as opposed to what the reproduction technology industry has advocated
for more than a century. Opacity, as the two authors demonstrate well,
is omnipresent in history and if, as a whole, the need to experience an
immediate relationship with what is represented – thanks to transparency
– seems dominant, our fascination for the performance of mediation in
work – which is a way to define opacity – never entirely disappears. It
is in fact a reversal of this tendency that we witnessed during the
decline of realism and the appearance of the avant-gardes. The principle
of opacity has therefore gained legitimacy, the avant-gardes even made
theatricality the substance and the concept of their shows. It thereby
opened an age of 'theatricalized theater' that we will no longer cease
to celebrate, first in restrained circles from Dada to Meyerhold, from
Artaud to Brecht, then on a larger scale with postmodernity. For
Postlewait and Davis, this change set in motion the progressive slide
from 'representational' to 'presentational' \[c556\] and brought to the
fore the performative dimension of mediation. We could add that this
also marked the end of the domination of the traditional mimetic regime.

Integrating the lessons of Mallarmé and Hegel, who sought to make
language – and poetic language – an autonomous universe, a world in
itself, the heavy theatrical machine therefore provided a
self-sufficient stage universe. This negation of the referential world
has conferred to theatricality an unequal status in history: it took on
a positive value and was simultaneously the end and the means of
performance. It also became a privileged object of study by
semioticians, whose influence overrode the entire field of human
sciences. The prestige of semiotics rebounded on theatricality and it is
in this context, or because of it, that theater studies emerged. Until
then, theater had been considered a literary genre and its study was
principally limited to that of dramatic text and their authors. In the
same way that presence had been recovered to impose an essentialist
conception of theater, theatricality would rely on major institutional
reform: we therefore note the emancipation of an integrated practice to
a discipline, the rise of theater to the status of a completely separate
field of university study. This brought out strange divides, including
the separation of the object of study and the literary: the literarity
(the text) confined to the departments of literature, theatricality
(what is left) brought to theater studies. It is in this sense that we
must understand the famous declaration of Roland Barthes, one of the
most influential French critiques of the 1950s and 1960s, who is also
one of the first theorists to use the word theatricality (from 1954):
'What is theatricality? It is theatre without the text, it is a density
of signs and sensations that manifests on stage \[...\]'.[^06chapter5_57]

From an intermedial point of view, this definition is obviously
absurd.[^06chapter5_58] Not only does the text participate in theatricality, but
theatricality is also in the text in the sense that it is the product of
a premediation, as Grusin uses the term: without exception, the text is
in fact conditioned, or pre-formated, by the practical conditions of the
stage representation in effect at the time of its writing. It is true
that this idea, evoked by Barthes, of the progressive construction of
meaning, that affects the domain of creation as much as that of
reception, includes a major performative dimension (the term
performativity had not yet entered into use in the mid 50s, at least in
the theater domain), it is above all the removal on which Barthes's
definition is founded – 'theatre without the text' – that made a lasting
impression on our minds. It is also what provoked a profound crisis from
which theater has not entirely recovered from six decades later.

With the avant-gardes and postmodernity burgeoning, the progressive
abandon of the representational, in favor of the presentational, paved
the way for a new approach marked by performativity and collaboration
between practices – from interdisciplinary to multidisciplinary. It
would have been logical that, in this context, the concept of
theatricality would simply be enriched by a performative dimension, but
two factors have inhibited this development. On the one hand, semiotic
thought has had the effect of turning the attention of researchers from
performativity to an in-between model (upon which the sign and mimesis
are founded) which, in some regards, marks a regression. On the other
hand, the marked interest of semioticians for theatricality had the
paradoxical effect of disqualifying it: the loss of influence of
semiotics renders the concept dubious and less respectable. But the
cause of the decline was not related to the questions of identity evoked
earlier: the appropriation of mediality (theatricality) by a discipline
(theater studies) can only, in fact, bring us back to earlier identity
reflexes in other disciplines, reigniting the essentialist flame:
theatricality became the mark of theater expansionism and this
remediation of the theater has been perceived as a threat to ontology in
other practices, that is, as a 'betrayal'.

The virulent attack of the American historian and art critic, Michael
Fried, against the 'theatralisation' of the visual artists, offers the
most memorable illustration of this. In 1967, judging that visual
artists were too excessively retracing theater's methods and mediating
strategies, he cautioned against the grave dangers that this attitude
runs in relation to their own practice. Michael Fried therefore calls
for a rejection of all theatricality in painting and in other fine arts:
'The success, even the survival of the arts has come increasingly to
depend on their ability to defeat theatre'.[^06chapter5_59]

Fried's initiative bears witness to two converging phenomena whose
effects would heavily weigh on the field of theater studies, as well as
on theater more generally. On the one hand, this call for 'survival' can
only be insured by the 'defeat' of theater, that is by the repression of
theatricality from within the field of theater. On the other hand, while
the concept of theatricality seems to be diverted from its most negative
connotations and benefitted, thanks to the prestige of semiotics and to
stage practices themselves, from unequal recognition, Fried attacked it
not only by relying on old prejudices, but in underlining the outdated
nature of the concept. By inviting minimalist artists to trade presence
for presentness, inspired by phenomenological thinking, Fried confirms
the triumph of the presentational and, indirectly, of the performative.

The attraction of the performativity concept derives largely from the
successes won by this new artistic practice, that is, performance and
the critical thought that it produces. But its most sudden breakthrough
within theater studies and the hegemony that this concept rapidly
exerted – and still exerts – is initially explained by the decline in
the concept of theatricality and by the void that its rejection created
(aggravated by the general decline in semiotic influence). Richard
Schechner and his collaborators for the renowned journal *Performance
Studies* have not waited to successfully apply the analytical principles
of performance to analyze theater shows, thereby publishing a major
shift in the course of theater studies. This 'performative turn' has
profoundly enriched the approach of theater performance and its
components, centering the observation precisely on the flow of actions
that are produced and the agencies that are deployed in all the
production phases of and during the theatrical event. To the criteria of
fidelity so closely tied to the representational, the tenants of
performativity have opposed this to the authenticity of the experience
of the performer, of course, but also that of the
viewer-experiencer-user, rendered co-creator. He separates himself, on
the one hand, from the image of the performer who (would) play his life;
on the other hand, he distances himself from that of the actor who
(would) represent one. Even if reality is not so simple – because it
always remains a part of the representational in any stage show and in
its components, because mimesis has never entirely disappeared – this
double equation remains.

In this era of the presentational, which was also an era of a 'new
sharing of the sensible' as Jacques Rancière[^06chapter5_60] describes it, we have
approached the theater performance not only as an autonomous object to
which we were exogenous observers: we view theater as an event in which
we participate, to the same extent as the 'observer' that Karen
Barad[^06chapter5_61] evokes, measuring the quantum 'events' for which it is an
implicated member. A question therefore arises: if this new sharing of
the sensible that Rancière evokes is necessarily performative, does
there exist a specific performative mode for the theater? And if so, how
do we characterize it?

This question obviously echoes that of the distinction between mediating
conjunctures, or between the ensembles of mediating conjunctures, that
we have discussed in chapter 3. Josette Féral, who has successively been
one of the influential theorists of theatricality and performativity,
very recently offered one possible response:

> To again interrogate the concept of theatricality \[...\] in light of
> the multiple developments of the performative that characterize a
> contemporary theatre stage in constant change is a must.[^06chapter5_62]

This suggestion is more than appropriate. By opposing theatricality and
performativity, and by privileging the latter at the expense of the
former – under the pretext that the latter is true and the former is
false or because the former is weighed down by a heavy negative
connotations (from enlargement and falsity to the semiotic aura), or
even because the latter continues to enjoy an immense prestige within
the human sciences – theater studies have perhaps not but retraced the
model of old binary categories that they themselves have endured. Are we
thereby still a part of the presentational era? Things evolve. We
observe a marked return of the character, that of the narrative and,
with it, that of mimesis obviously in renewed but recognizable forms. If
we think for example about specific processes of documentary theater or
of the use and nature of visual and sound projections that henceforth
accompany all productions. We can hardly imagine, today, a theater
performance without a soundtrack and video projections have entered into
stage use.

To the question, 'does a theatrical performativity exist?', we respond
'yes'. All mediation is performative and, of course, a theatrical
performativity does exist, and is constantly redefined. This theatrical
performativity stems from an ensemble of mediating conjunctures that we
call theatricality. Performativity is therefore neither the successor
nor the substitute of theatricality; it is a component that is central
and necessary because there is no mediation that is not performative.
What distinguishes this performativity from other performativities is
its theatricality, it is the ensemble of mediating conjunctures to which
it is attached and which, in the best of cases, results in a theater
show.

### Conclusion

The results of our analyses reinforce the hypothesis underpinning the
notion of mediating conjunctures: it is impossible to identify a single
and determined mediating conjuncture in abstracting other conjunctures
which participate in the mediating process. Each act identifying the
particularities of a mediation situation consists in 'isolating'
mediating conjunctures, which are dynamic and have no frontier. The
place of representational and performative paradigms, in the theater and
in the digital turn, offers, in this regard, an illuminating an example.

In this book, we have highlighted the increased strength of the
performative paradigm at the expense of the representational paradigm.
From an essentialist point of view, we could believe that we are living
in an era when mediation forms are therefore characterized by this
paradigm and that there is no longer a place for mimesis and for
representation. And yet, the reality is more complex: identifying the
actions tied to each of these paradigms only occurs as a result of a
particular kind of observation of mediating conjunctures. This
observation consists in isolating a vast movement in order to focus our
attention on only one part of their complex and open structure.

The 'digital turn' and the 'theater' therefore form 'parts' of mediating
conjunctures which, in themselves, are not separated into discrete
units. We can identify reoccurring forms in what makes up these
conjunctures and, among its forms, it is in fact possible to notice a
presence and a performative tendency. But we can just as well also turn
our gaze to other elements and other reoccurrences. In this case, for
example, we could associate the return of a character and of a
narrative, in the theater domain, to the rapid development of virtual
reality technology for fictional or entertainment purposes. We could
therefore identify the emergence of a contradictory tendency to that of
the performative paradigm, according to which mimesis is destined for a
strong comeback due to the necessity of preserving the very possibility
of producing a diegesis. So that one may tell a story, it is fundamental
that the story's world be clearly separated from the world in which the
reader or the spectator find themselves: it is necessary to put the
reader and the spectator in a position to receive a representation.

The contribution of the notion of mediating conjunctures offers the
possibility of identifying patterns and attributing them to an
ontological meaning. This refers not only to interpretations of reality:
it is reality itself that is open to observation. But at the same time,
reality is plural because it is made from mediating conjunctures that
are simultaneously the context and the outcome of the actions of
elements that are involved.

The intermedial approach, in this sense, merges in an attempt to bring
together agency and structure, constructivism and realism, which seems

[^06chapter5_25]: Referring to Pythagoras's famous lessons given to his disciples,
    wherein he separated himself from them by a curtain so that they
    heard him without seeing him, Pierre Schaeffer developed the concept
    of acousmatic sound by demonstrating the role played by sight in
    relation to hearing. (see Pierre Schaeffer, *Traité Des Objets
    Musicaux: Essai Interdisciplines*, Paris: Seuil, 2002, p. 91 and
    ff).

[^06chapter5_26]: This concept is difficult to pin down, firstly because it is
    complex, but also because it has not ceased to evolve. For the
    purposes of this study, we will limit ourselves to the definition
    offered by Philip Auslander: 'In theatrical parlance, *presence*
    usually refers either to the relationship between actor and audience
    – the actor as manifestation before an audience – or, more
    specifically, to the actor's psychophysical attractiveness to the
    audience, a concept related to that of *charisma*. Concepts of
    presence are grounded in notions of actorly representation; the
    actor's presence is often thought to derive from her embodiment of,
    or even possession by, the character defined in a play text, from
    the (re)presentation of self through the mediation of character, or,
    in the Artaudian/Grotowskian/Beckian line of thought, from the
    archetypal psychic impulses accessible through the actor's
    physicality, Philip Auslander, *Presence and Resistance:

[^06chapter5_58]: Maurice Merleau-Ponty, *Phenomenology of Perception*, London, New
    York: Routledge, 1962, citing Proust's *The Guermantes Way,* talks
    about the actress Berma playing the role of Phaedra. At the heart of
    the analysis that he offers is a critique of the idea of theater as
    representation. The theater experience consists in once again
    rendering present an event that is no longer there. The actor would
    therefore represent a character, in a structure strongly opposing
    the subject and the object: an object represented and a subject
    representing. Merleau-Ponty's idea is, by contrast, that theater in
    no way engenders a representative structure. The relationship
    between actor and character can be considered as an explanatory
    example of what is produced in the chiasmus between visible and
    invisible.

    We are not before a visible center – once upon a time there was
    Phaedra – that is reproduced, represented here and now thanks to the
    actor's action. It is more a case of the invisible, and this
    invisibility structures all the visible; Phaedra is the invisible.
    What is produced on stage is a sort of embodiment: the actor becomes
    the visibility of the invisible; it is therefore Phaedra on stage
    and not Berma. Here we are close to Deleuze's statement according to
    which roles supersede actors; but, certainly, Merleau-Ponty's notion
    is more complex. In the classical structure, the spectator would be caught in between
    two poles: he would ask himself if he sees Phaedra (the before) or
    Berma (the after), if Berma is none other than that which brings
    Phaedra into existence or if Phaedra is not but a deferred
    manifestation of Berma, and it is therefore not only according to
    the latter that we can conceive of the former. But in the experience of theater we do not at all feel this tension
    and this polarity. We do, however, perceive a chiasmus, the
    encroachment of Phaedra towards Berma. The spectator is not able to
    see Berma all while knowing that the actress is in the process of
    playing the role of Phaedra; the spectator perceives the single unit
    of role and of actor. It is not possible to see Phaedra on stage
    without Berma, but we can neither perceive Berma without Phaedra.
    Proust realizes this when he asserts that whatever he had studied in
    advance on Phaedra's role, which in principle would be the common
    ground of all the actresses that play Phaedra, to be capable of
    subtracting it, of not gathering it as the residue of Mrs. Berma's
    talent, he notices that this talent is only made with the role.

Article-title: Media Do Not Exist. Performativity and Mediating Conjunctures
Article-status: accepted
Author: Jean-Marc Larrue, Marcello Vitali-Rosati
Abstract:   This essay offers a radically new approach to the phenomena of mediation, proposing a new understanding of the media processes that challenge the very notion of media. It begins with a historical overview of recent developments in Western thought on mediation, especially since the mid '80s and the emergence of Media Archaeology and Intermediality. While these developments are inseparable from the advent of digital technology, they have a long history.
Keywords:   media, mediation, performativity, mediating conjunctures, media archaeology, intermediality, digital technology, philosophy.

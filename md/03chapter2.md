# Essence and Performativity

## Introduction

In Chapter 1, we described the history of intermedial thinking as a
gradual transition from a theory of media, constructed as objects, to a
theory of the end of media – a 'postmediatic' theory. This development
was accompanied by a steady decline in essentialist ways of thinking
about media. Intermediality can therefore be said to have sprung from
the shift from an essentialist heuristic (based on the assumed existence
of competing media) towards a non-essentialist heuristic (there are no
media but rather dynamic convergences that produce forms of mediation,
what we call 'mediating conjunctures' – see Chapter 3). We therefore
divide intermedial thinking into two periods: the mediatic and the
postmediatic.

We believe this important development calls for further analysis for two
reasons. First, because it is a paradigm shift that cannot be understood
as a linear progression, as a teleologically ordained advance from a
flawed theory to a better one. In fact, both the essentialist and
non-essentialist paradigms run through the history of Western thought.
Indeed, the debate between their proponents may be considered a pivotal
theme in the history of philosophy since its inception. Secondly, while
essentialist thinking poses serious problems for our apprehension of the
world, a radically and exclusively non-essentialist approach may land us
in different, but equally insurmountable, theoretical pitfalls.

We might put it this way: the need to avoid reducing media practices to
reiterations of actions that were predetermined by a medium's
specificity calls for postmediatic thinking, but can we escape the need
to characterize media practices and understand the specific features by
which they are distinguished? In short, while the complex concept of
'medium', as understood prior to the postmediatic period, exposes the
difficulties of a radically essentialist stance, its critique brings us
up against the limitations of any non-essentialist position. If we try
to define one medium's characteristics in order to distinguish it from
another – to articulate the difference between a printed book and an
e-book, for example, or between a play and a movie that tell the same
story – we take medium and content to be mutually independent (the
position defended by Jenkins[^03chapter2_1] and Elleström[^03chapter2_2] ), which confronts us
with the paradox of imagining content without a medium, ready to be
shaped in one manner or another, depending on the chosen medium. If, on
the other hand, we take the non-essentialist view and suppose that
content and medium are inseparable, how then can we identify the
characteristic features of a given medium, or even discuss them? How can
we contemplate the very existence of media specificities? The
non-essentialist perspective could logically lead to a sweeping
conflation of media practices. In this case, ontological interrogations
must be set aside, for media constellations do exist, if not in reality
at least discursively. It would be naïve to think that non-essentialism
could simply displace and replace essentialism.

Given the limitations of both positions, we will begin by expanding our
critical analysis of essentialism from a philosophical perspective,
drawing on the concept of performativity. In chapters 3 and 4, we will
look at how the essentialist / non-essentialist contradiction can be
transcended in order to escape the opposed perils of conflation and
static categorization.

## Essence and Flux: The Irreducibility of Movement

The history of Western philosophy starts with the apparently
irresolvable aporia produced by the opposition between the one and the
many. The first philosophers picked one side or the other, defending
either the unity of reality or its plurality. Most of the questions that
have claimed the attention of philosophers in the West and beyond arise
from this opposition. Briefly put, unity is the notion that makes the
ideas of essence and concept possible, whereas multiplicity grounds the
possibility of motion and freedom. This debate remains pertinent to this
day and the theoretical issues it throws up will inform our reflections
on media.

In Book 1 of the *Metaphysics*, Aristotle discusses the ideas of
Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic School, who held that reality is
one. As Aristotle notes, the difficulty with this position is how to
account for motion, since Parmenides is 'compelled to accord with
phenomena'.[^03chapter2_3] As we observe the world, we see that it is in motion,
that things mutate and change, that they do not abide in immobile
oneness. The Eleatics maintained that observation of phenomena was
deceptive: in reality, there is no motion and things do stay as they
are. In his famous paradoxes,[^03chapter2_4] Parmenides' pupil Zeno tries to
illustrate the logical absurdities that ensue from the idea of motion
and its incompatibility with reason. Motion is irrational. In the
paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, Zeno imagines Achilles racing a
tortoise. Achilles, the much swifter runner, gives the tortoise a
10-metre head start. The race begins and Achilles quickly covers the
first 10 metres. But in the meantime, the tortoise has also advanced a
few centimetres. So it is still ahead. It will take Achilles only an
instant to cover those centimetres, but in that time the tortoise will
have moved a miniscule distance, which will still separate it from
Achilles. Ultimately, Achilles will never be able to overtake the
tortoise. From this line of reasoning, Zeno deduces that motion is an
illusion: we inhabit a shifting world of appearances but in truth, all
is immobile, for motion is a contradiction.

Other philosophers, of course, defend a diametrically opposed position:
Heraclitus sides with motion and arrives at the conclusion that there is
no unity or essence, only flux: 'No man ever steps in the same river
twice',[^03chapter2_5] for everything is in movement, 'everything flows'.

The opposition between the one and the many is central to the dialogue
Plato entitled the *Parmenides*, believed to be one of his last. It has
been read as self-criticism, for Plato seems to be concerned with flaws
in the essentialist view of the world, the very approach he had embraced
with his theory of forms.

Plato poses a simple question: how can we move from one point to
another? In other words, how are we to explain change?[^03chapter2_6] The
difficulty resides in the fact that any essentialist theory rests on the
principle of non-contradiction. Nothing can have two contradictory
properties: it is not possible for a thing (A) to have a property (+p)
and not have it (-p). This principle is sometimes bracketed with the
'identity principle': the proposition that we cannot say a thing
possesses an attribute and its opposite (p and not p) is the equivalent
of saying that it is what it is.

Non-contradiction is therefore also the logical principle that allows us
to ascribe a stable identity to a thing, to establish its essence. For a
thing to have an essence, it must have certain properties and not their
opposites. For example, according to the principle of non-contradiction,
a chair cannot be white and, at the same time, not white. If we paint it
blue, a change has occurred. The first chair is no more, and we now have
a different chair. This is not a problem if we consider the two chairs,
white and blue, separately. The difficulty arises when we try to
establish a relationship between them. How do we get from the white
chair to the blue one? What is in between the two? We would have to be
able to speak of a chair that is white and not white, or blue and not
blue.

This is exactly the paradoxical question that Plato asks in the
*Parmenides*: how can we get from stasis to motion? Untangling the
problem rationally poses daunting challenges: at a given point in time
(T), there is a motionless object; at another (T~1~), an object in
motion. How can we account for this change? As can be seen, this is the
same conundrum as the problem of the chair. First (T) there is a white
chair; then (T~1~) a blue chair. To progress from time T to time T~1~,
we must imagine a transition between the two, a paradoxical instant in
which the thing is in motion and not in motion, or the chair is white
and not white. In that instant, the principle of non-contradiction does
not apply.

Plato calls this paradoxical transition by the Greek word
*exaiphnes*,[^03chapter2_7] which means, precisely, 'instant'. The *exaiphnes* is
an in-between, an inter-space where opposites coexist; it might
therefore be translated as 'interval'. Plato's discussion of the concept
is highly complex and has been the subject of diverse interpretations
for centuries. These may be organized into two opposed camps:[^03chapter2_8] the
*exaiphnes*, as the in-between, is either the locus of contradiction or
a non-locus where mediation is effected. If the *exaiphnes* is a locus,
it is a conflicted space, a place where opposites coexist, the tragic
scene of a contradiction. This conception of the in-between is precisely
what Sibony picks up on,[^03chapter2_9] as we have seen. From this view, the
*exaiphnes* is the site where the white chair and blue chair coexist.
But the *exaiphnes* can also be conceived as a non-locus, something that
escapes space and time, a void, an abyss. In the first interpretation,
the *exaiphnes* is the instant in which a thing at once possesses a
property and does not, in which the chair is white and not white. In the
second, it is the mysterious nowhere in which the thing has neither one
property nor the other, the chair is neither white nor not white.

The defining features of intermedial thinking are readily discernable in
this logical structure: on the one hand, the attempt (typical of
intermediality's mediatic period) to situate the in-between as the site
where two or more media coexist; on the other, the jettisoning of the
concept of medium in favor of media practices, proceeding from the
concept of mediation. But in either interpretation, the *exaiphnes*
poses serious problems for our attempts to rationally account for what
we see. It is difficult to wrap our minds around any challenge to the
principle of non-contradiction, for our thinking and language are
predicated upon it. We shall return to this question in Chapter 4, where
we examine processes of naturalization.

## Discrete, Continuous, Digital

Our analysis of the philosophical premises underpinning the distinction
between the mediatic and postmediatic periods in intermedial thinking
can be taken one step further: the opposition between essence and motion
can be correlated with another, more formal antithesis between discrete
and continuous. As shall be seen, these two categories also ground the
distinction between analog and digital, which is critically important in
current discourses about media.

The discrete and the continuous are two opposed forms of representation
of reality. The mathematical difficulty of rendering them commensurable
is, in a sense, at the root of the paradoxes we have described. To
define these two terms, which in general physics correspond to the
distinction between particle and wave, it may be said that an object is
discrete when it consists of a set of (finite or infinite) unitary,
indivisible parts. Whole numbers are discrete: there is nothing between
1 and 2; the numbers 1, 2 and 3 are each unitary, indivisible elements.
Similarly, a fruit basket is a set of discrete parts, for it consists of
a series of indivisible units, each single fruit. By contrast, a
continuous object is not made up of parts but is always further
divisible, and its distinguishing property is density: between point A
and point B there is always an infinite series of points. Real numbers
are continuous. Water is continuous. One cannot have one water or two
waters; it is a dense body.

The difficulty of understanding the transition from stasis to motion,
and the paradoxes that attend interpretations of change in general,
derive from the impossibility of explaining the continuity of reality
starting from a series of discrete units. To return to our chair
example, the observation that there was a white chair and then a blue
chair clearly hinges on a discretization of reality: we isolate two
objects and posit them as whole, unitary, indivisible parts of reality.
White chair (1), blue chair (2). When we try to understand what happens
between points 1 and 2, we are forced to shift from the discrete to the
continuous, and this raises a number of difficulties, beginning with a
mathematical dilemma.

The problem is that our language is inherently discrete (consisting of
words, phonemes, etc.) while reality appears continuous. The attempt to
understand the objects of perception using our discretizing apparatus is
troubled by paradoxes, the resolution of which can be counted among
humanity's loftiest aspirations. It might be said that all scientific
thought – and technical thinking in particular – strives to refine our
apparatus for discretizing reality in order to grasp the world as a
continuous system without eliding its complexity.

Digital may be seen as the most recent and potent expression of this
endeavour, which can be traced through the history of science from the
Greeks to Leibniz to contemporary sampling theory. In its primary
meaning, 'digital' refers to the recording of sounds and images (or
other information) as discrete data points, as opposed to the continuous
recording mode used by analog. Analog recording reproduces phenomena in
a way that is analogous to reality, that is, continuous. The sound curve
inscribed on a vinyl record is continuous; if we take any two points on
it, we will always find an infinite number of points between them. The
curve is therefore 'dense' in the mathematical sense of the word. By
contrast, the digital principle breaks the continuity of sound into
discrete parts. This discretization process is what is called
'sampling'. In practical terms, it consists in taking a continuous sound
wave and selecting sample points from it. This method doesn't capture
the sound as a whole but rather the changes between set intervals. A
shorter interval will yield more precise sampling and therefore digital
sound of higher quality. However, the sound has an inherently lower
grade than that produced by analog recording, since it does not reflect
the continuity of the original, but only a number – albeit a high number
in many cases – of sample points. The discretization process simplifies
the recorded sound by reducing it to a series of whole numbers,
specifically 0's and 1's. This simplification makes the reproductions
easier to manipulate.

To sum up, it can be said that analog is more 'faithful' to reality, for
it is continuous, but it is very difficult to transport, transmit,
archive, describe and manipulate, while digital is less 'faithful' since
it is discrete but easier to work with. Ironically, the industry
supported the move from analog to digital on the grounds that it would
improve sound quality, repeating the logic of the original argument
about fidelity and high-fidelity discussed in Chapter 1. This disconnect
between discourse and reality is indicative of the complex, non-linear
relationship between tools, practices and discourses that underpins
sociomedialities, the constantly shifting civil groupings produced by
social dynamics.

However, analysis of the digital / analog duality clarifies the main
advantage of discretization. While it doesn't provide a 'faithful'
representation of reality, it does yield a better purchase on reality, a
way to master it, understand it, manage it. Discretization is the basis
of technical thinking: if we want to have a working knowledge of the
world, knowledge that enables us to act on reality, we must divide it
into discrete parts.

## Media and Action

We will now try to apply these formal principles to the question of
media and mediation. The discrete / continuous opposition provides
another angle from which we may attempt to chart a middle course between
the radically essentialist and radically non-essentialist positions. On
the one hand, it is not possible to reduce the continuity of reality to
a series of distinct, immobile units, which in our case would mean
reducing media practices to stable media. On the other hand, we need to
be able to articulate a (discretizing) discourse about them. How can we
do so without identifying them, without marking their boundaries?

As we have seen, the concept of medium carries a heavy essentialist
burden: the in-between is understood as a solid, a thing. In this case,
media are objects; each medium – radio, television, the Web – has its
own specificity. The essentialist approach renders shifting
configurations discrete and graspable, but it thereby runs the risk of
reifying them and suppresses a critical factor: action.

Defined in formal terms, an action is anything that can be expressed by
a verb (other than a stative verb). An action can be of many sorts:
loving, thinking, suffering, moving, feeling, and so forth. So an action
exists where there is movement, a process. It is what occurs within the
continuity and flow of reality. The idea of an in-between that serves as
a passage between two discrete units therefore runs counter to the
conception of action as a continuous movement that cannot be reduced to
two poles. The irreducibility of action renders it incompatible with
discretization. This is precisely what Zeno's paradoxes demonstrate:
within the confines of a reality mapped as a series of discrete points,
action is impossible. Achilles will never be able to overtake the
tortoise. In an unconditionally essentialist frame of reference such as
Zeno's, there is no room for verbs, with the sole exception of the verb
'to be'. The postmediatic approach therefore spurns the concept of
medium in favor of mediation, a move that enables it to restore the
centrality of action. This is the argument Alexander Galloway makes in
his essay *The Interface Effect*, to which we shall return.[^03chapter2_10]

In a way, the first intermedialists' efforts to understand the human and
non-human mechanisms and agents, at work in the complexes they called
media, served precisely to define media on the basis of stable,
recognizable features, and therefore to essentialize them by focusing on
their elements rather than on what they do, *i.e.* the process of
mediation. This useful and indeed necessary fragmentation for the
purposes of observation led the early intermedialists to define three
structures of mediation, which they believed could be used to pin down
the specificity of each medium: the *support*,[^03chapter2_11] the interface and
the apparatus. One medium could be distinguished from another by the
particular type of mediation it performs. It was believed that this
approach would make it possible to delineate the specific
characteristics of media practices. In other words, by looking at the
*support*, the interface or the apparatus, they would be able to grasp
the specificity of the 'theatrical apparatus' in relation to the
'cinematic apparatus', or of a 'digital interface' compared with another
interface, or of print as a *support* compared with a computer monitor.
These three categories effectively encompass the normative dimension of
media – that is, they articulate how a specific medium structures,
shapes and determines an action. (As we shall see, these processes can
also be described using Grusin's concept of premediation, or the idea of
'affordance' advanced by Donald Norman.[^03chapter2_12]) The categories of
*support*, interface and apparatus therefore perform a key function in
differentiating media practices and grounding their identities. But, at
the same time, they confront us with a series of aporias and paradoxes
that cannot be ignored. After briefly defining the three terms, we will
attempt to show why their use is problematic.

## *Support*

Let us begin with the concept of *support*, a term with multiple
meanings that pervades French discourse about media despite its
polysemic character. Etymologically, it refers to something that is
under something else and holds it up. It is a base that structures the
thing it bears. This primary meaning can be illustrated by the holder or
trellis that supports a plant, or by the verb 'to support' in the sense
of providing physical or moral succour.[^03chapter2_13] One can rest on a *support*
or rest something on it. But when we look at a plant holder, we see that
it isn't just a base on which a plant stands. A *support* is more than a
foundation or a pedestal. Unlike a foundation, it structures and shapes
the thing it holds up. A plant holder is the object on which the plant
stands, to be sure, but it can also mould a plant, making it grow
straight or at the desired angle.

We must begin by asking what it is the *support* holds up.
Theoretically, it could be anything – a plant, a person, or (and this is
what interests us) an idea, content or information. To speak of a
*support* means there must be a thing that can be imagined – or at least
named – that existed before it was supported. First there is a plant,
and then, if it is placed against a trellis, it will grow as the trellis
bends it; it will assume a given shape. First there are people, and
providing them with support will help them live more fulfilling lives or
at least ease their pain. First there are ideas, and the *support* helps
them take form, materialize. This point bears repeating: speaking of a
*support* presupposes the prior existence of the thing that will be
supported. This idea is implicit in the term 'content': content is
something that exists separately from the *support* that holds it.

Secondly, we need to ask how the *support* structures the thing it
supports. The answers may vary. Its structuring effect may be great or
small. For example, a mature tree may be supported by a post to keep it
from bending beneath the wind. Without the support, the tree would
nonetheless continue to grow, perhaps at a slant, and it would remain
more or less the same tree. In the case of water, the *support* has far
greater structuring power: without a container, water has no form and
cannot be grasped, isolated or identified. Water takes the shape of its
container.

A *support* for ideas, content and information can be said to operate in
much the same way. Content (data, ideas, information, etc.) can be
considered independent and self-sufficient to varying degrees, depending
on one's point of view. The role of the *support* is to receive it and
structure it. Content may be likened to the tree – the *support* only
keeps it from growing warped – or on the contrary to water, which is
completely shaped by the *support*. In either case, the conceptual
structure is the same. On one side, there is the content; on the other,
the *support* which structures it and which *is* the medium, in a sense.
For example, a printed book can be considered the *support* for writing;
the book is what holds the writing and partially structures it. The same
text could be conveyed in another form, such as parchment or a monitor.
The various *supports* are therefore understood as different ways of
mediating between the writing and its reception. First came the writing,
and then the document in the form in which we are reading it. The
document changes form depending on the *support*. A different *support*,
a different medium produces a different mediation. Clearly, the extent
of the difference will depend on the structuring power we ascribe to the
*support*. In writing like the tree – the difference between reading it
in print or on a monitor is not huge, or more like water – the
difference is pronounced since water can assume any shape.

This is precisely the idea McLuhan critiques in *Understanding Media*.
The media theoretician showed that a medium cannot be separated from its
content. The understanding of *support* and content outlined above
raises two conundrums: what would writing without a *support* look like,
and what would the *support* be if it bore no writing? There is no easy
answer to this two-pronged question. We can readily imagine a bottle
without water, but what about a book without writing or writing that is
inscribed on nothing? This takes us to the heart of the debate about
media that has followed from McLuhan's analysis. If a medium establishes
a mediation between two things, it becomes difficult if not impossible
to separately identify those two things.

Bruno Bachimont considers digital a *support*. He observes that things
that exist in non-digital form (such as books, videocassettes, photos)
can be transferred to the digital realm, calling this migration
'recontextualisation'.[^03chapter2_14] The *support*, then, is the context in which
the content appears. According to this logic, there is always a
*support*. There is no writing or video without a *support*; they have
only moved from one to another. But still, how is it possible to speak
of transferring content from one *support* to another unless we are able
to bracket the *support* and focus on the content? In other words, if we
say we are transferring a video from cassette to digital, we assume the
video exists apart from its holder. Or, we must assume that the holder
itself has been transformed, which amounts to saying that the mediation
is a mediation of a mediation, as McLuhan suggests when he says that the
content of a medium is always another medium: the book contains the
writing, which contains text, which contains language, and so on *ad
infinitum*. In practical terms, it amounts to essentializing mediation,
to making the mediation process itself an object, a substance, more than
a *support*. Ultimately, this substance – whether it is a book, a screen
or a cassette – supports only itself. Can we still call this substance a
medium if the things it mediates no longer exist?

These considerations suggest that the very idea of *support* is
problematic for intermedial discourse: Bolter and Grusin's concept of
remediation already underscored this difficulty, and McLuhan elucidated
the impossibility of the unmediated object, for mediation is always a
mediation of something. Therefore, the medium does not produce a
mediation but rather a remediation. In line with this logic, a *support*
can only hold another *support* and can never truly support content.

## Interface

The concept of interface reproduces the same theoretical structure. The
prefix 'inter-' also refers to an in-between, in this case to the
interstice between user and machine, or between a graphical platform and
a code. If the *support* is the mediation between the pure idea and the
idea incarnate, the interface is the mediation between inside and
outside, the transition zone.

But, as Alexander Galloway shows, the window metaphor often used to
describe the interface cannot fully account for its role and
function.[^03chapter2_15] While a window frames a relationship between two spaces,
it does not explain what happens in passing from one to the other. The
interface is an in-between that effects a transition between two sites
and is in this sense a mediation. Where the concept of *support* posits
the existence of a thing that takes a different form than it initially
had because of the in-between constituted by the *support*, the concept
of interface offers the possibility of transforming content in an
intermediate space in order to adapt it for a different space. The
transition zone between inside and outside is the place where content is
transformed to make it intelligible on the other side of the threshold.
To bring inside and outside face to face, there must be a link, like the
lens in eyeglasses, that serves as the 'inter-face'.

A simple example is the interface that renders code usable by human
beings. To take an everyday instance, a webpage is text marked up in
html (hypertext markup language). An html tag is not intuitively
interpreted by human beings: the code's 'inside' must be transformed by
mediation to make it usable on the 'outside' by the viewer. To do so, a
software application, in this case a browser, serves as the interface
and transforms the code into the graphically organized page that users
see on the screen. We therefore have two poles – the code and the page
displayed – and an in-between – the interface – which mediates between
the two and enables the passage from one to the other.

This example raises a series of problems as soon as we endeavour to
analyze it more closely. First, the identification of the two poles is
dubious. As we saw with the *support*, when we go looking for the
'original content' we quickly realize there is no content that isn't
already a product of mediation. In the case of html, the code plainly
results from interpretation of another code, which transforms a series
of 0's and 1's into alphanumeric characters through the process called
character encoding. The computer cannot generate text directly; it can
do so only through a mediation – an interface – between text and
numbers, based on a defined character set (such as UTF-8).

We therefore arrive at other content, the series of 1's and 0's. But
this content is also the product of a mediation: the numbers must be
converted into a series of electrical signals (on = 1, off = 0). And the
electrical signals must in turn be interfaced with the circuitry, and so
on *ad infinitum*. So we're back to the structure of mediation described
by McLuhan, and the concept of interface loses its meaning once we
realize that anything can be defined as an interface: any point may be
read as a threshold, as a passage between one thing and another. That is
precisely the structure we described when we looked at the concept of
hypermediacy. So the question is not so much whether there is a passage
or whether we are in it but rather what specific effects the mediation
produces in a given situation. In other words, we must consider whether
the mediation determines the content in question, and if so, how.

## Apparatus

The concept of apparatus[^03chapter2_16] is more helpful than the other two notions
we have discussed in understanding how a mediation produces something.
The central question relates to what occurs in the instant of mediation.
How does the moment of mediation determine the meaning and structure of
the thing that is mediated? For example, how does printing a book
determine its content? Or how does publishing an article on the Web
determine its meaning, reliability and substance?

Grusin uses the principle of 'premediation'[^03chapter2_17] to analyze the force of
predetermination in mediation. The structural organization of television
illustrates the workings of premediation: the frame is set in advance;
the time allocated to each specific type of content, to commercials and
to the entire palimpsest is predefined. This framework has a decisive
effect on everything we see on the screen.

'Affordance', particularly as Donald Norman defines it in his work on
design, is a variety of predetermination that formally parallels
premediation. Affordance is what a tool suggests by its shape and
structure. Every technical object carries within itself a
predetermination of the action it will set in motion: a chair invites
the user to sit on it, a doorknob to turn it, a button to press it.

These principles of predetermination are inscribed in the notion of the
apparatus, a complicated concept that demands clarification. To begin
with Foucault's definition, an apparatus is 'a resolutely heterogeneous
body composed of discourses, institutions, architectural arrangements,
regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific
statements, philosophical propositions, morals, philanthropy – in short,
both the said and the unsaid.'[^03chapter2_18] This understanding of apparatus,
which can be compared with the concept of institution developed and
popularized by Pierre Bourdieu, is a central term for Foucault. Giorgio
Agamben provides a three-point synthetic definition, based on Foucault:

a.  An apparatus is a heterogeneous set that includes virtually
    > > anything, linguistic and nonlinguistic, under the same heading:
    > > discourses, institutions, buildings, laws, police measures,
    > > philosophical propositions, and so on. The apparatus itself is
    > > the network that is established between these elements.

b.  The apparatus always has a concrete strategic function and is always
    > > located in a power relation.

c.  As such, it appears at the intersection of power relations and
    > > relations of knowledge.[^03chapter2_19]

This definition recalls Éliséo Véron's definition of a medium, cited
above.[^03chapter2_20] The apparatus is the network that binds together this
heterogeneous constellation and it performs an organizing function. It
is a set of discursive and technical elements that determines actions
and behaviours. The apparatus structures the realm of possibility. For
example, a classroom is an apparatus. A heterogeneous array of factors –
the architecture, the arrangement of tables and chairs, the school's
authority, the teacher's role, the subject matter's place in the
curriculum and in the collective imagination, etc. – shapes what
transpires in the classroom, namely the course. Each apparatus has its
specific affordance and premediation: a classroom designed as a lecture
hall will prompt the teacher to deliver lectures and inhibit the
functioning of any other type of activity, such as a workshop.

Bruno Bachimont stresses the determinative and even prescriptive power
of the apparatus, which he describes as a 'physical and spatial
organization capable of producing and determining a process. The essence
of the apparatus is that its spatial configuration determines temporal
behaviour.'[^03chapter2_21] In other words, the apparatus transforms space into
time. The combustion engine illustrates the process: it is a 'physical
and spatial structure organized to produce a temporal cycle.'[^03chapter2_22] The
same applies to the classroom: the arrangement of the room and the set
of spoken and unspoken rules that define its meaning and function
produce and delimit the actions that can be performed within its walls.
In Bachimont's terms, the classroom is an apparatus because it is a
space that produces time and action of the course.

The apparatus, then, is what produces a mediation; it might be said that
it is located between the intention and the completed action. For
example, let us imagine an academic class; the apparatus 'course' is
located between the course imagined by the teacher and the course she
delivers is the classroom, which determines and structures her actions.
Indeed, it is impossible to conceive of a course without the space in
which it is conducted, for the space establishes the 'course format'.
Clearly, the space is not created *ex nihilo*; as it is part of a larger
complex – the institution, its protocols, its history, power
relationships, expectations, and so forth – that endow it with its
structuring power. It may therefore be concluded that the apparatus
determines behaviours and actions.

Proceeding from the concepts of *support*, interface and apparatus, we
can now attempt to tease out the meanings of the word mediation. We will
distinguish among four types: formal, communicative, phenomenological
and teleological.

In a purely formal sense, any process that links two things can be
called a mediation. This is the type of mediation we find in the notion
of the *exaiphnes*. The transition from point A to point B presupposes a
linkage between them, and that link is a mediation. The advantage of
this definition is that it posits mediation as a fundamental structure
of our connection to the world. The relationship between stasis and
motion, discrete and continuous, content and container can all be
conceived in terms of mediation. The problem with this definition is its
breadth; there is nothing that is not mediation. It is therefore too
all-encompassing to be useful as an operational definition for a theory
of media.

From the standpoint of communication theory, mediation may be defined in
Claude Shannon's terms, as the process by which a message is transmitted
from a sender to a receiver. This model is particularly well suited to
analyzing the semiotics of media practices; that is, for investigating
the production and circulation of meaning via different types of media.
A book carries the meaning of its content and conveys it to readers. One
limitation of the communication approach is that it does not lend itself
to analysis of forms that do not seem to involve the transmission of
meaning, and yet clearly qualify as media practices in our view.[^03chapter2_23]
For example, most Web activities serve instrumental ends more than
communicative purposes and are not readily reducible to an exchange of
messages. When we buy a book online, we are not having a conversation
with someone, but rather manipulating objects, just as if we had made
the purchase in a bookshop. To be sure, the online transaction, or the
bookstore purchase for that matter, can be considered a form of
communication, but that amounts to saying that everything is
communication, much as everything is mediation in the formal sense
discussed above. We find ourselves up against the same problem of
generalization.

A third possibility is to ascribe a more phenomenological meaning to
mediation and regard it as the condition of possibility for perception.
This approach was already suggested by Aristotle in *On the Soul* and
has been picked up more recently by intermedialists such as Lars
Elleström. To summarize, mediation is the process that makes perceptible
to the mind something that would not otherwise be so. This definition
has the merit of being wide enough to embrace a series of media
practices without necessarily leading us back to communication theory.
The problem is its anthropocentric – or, at the very least, anthropo-
and zoo-centric – bias. The rise of information technology forces us to
question this limitation, for the digital arena is occupied in large
part by machine-to-machine interactions that have nothing to do with
perception. Can those interactions be excluded from the realm of
mediation? Another difficulty with this approach is the existence of
practices – the magic show being the most salient example – in which the
effect of the mediation is to make imperceptible what would otherwise
have been perceptible.

Lastly, there is a teleological conception of mediation: mediation is
what makes it possible to reach an end. It is the tool used to perform
an action, the hammer that drives in the nail. This is the dominant idea
behind our discussion of *support*, interface and apparatus: mediation
is what enables and structures the action. This approach is compelling
but comes with its own flaws: it emphasizes that mediation is a
determinant of action, which is certainly true, but neglects the fact
that the instant of action is subject to an element of indetermination
as well. The concept of performativity offers us a theoretical handle on
that indetermination.

## Performativity in Intermediality

Postmediatic intermedial thinking dismisses essentialist arguments and
foregrounds necessarily situational processes of convergence. From this
point of view, there are no media; there are only dynamics – or, in
Dworkin's terms, media are not things, but rather activities.[^03chapter2_24]
Reality is no longer apprehended as a series of immobile objects endowed
with an essence, but as motion itself. There are no things, only
movement; no essence, only action; no media, only convergences that
produce mediations.

Clearly, this is not a recent opinion; as we have seen, it was first
propounded by Heraclitus, the philosopher of flux and motion. Not only
is this point of view not new but neither is it confined to philosophy.
Nietzsche's critique of ontological thinking invites a number of
arguments that have informed not only intermedial thinking, but a wide
swath of contemporary research in the humanities, most notably in gender
studies. For example, Judith Butler's questioning of traditional
conceptions of sexual identity in *Gender Trouble* has some bearing on
our own field inquiry:

> The challenge for rethinking gender categories outside of the
> metaphysics of substance will have to consider the relevance of
> Nietzsche's claim \[...\] that 'there is no "being" behind doing,
> effecting, becoming; the "doer" is merely a fiction added to the deed
> – the deed is everything'. \[...\] \[W\]e might state as a corollary:
> There is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that
> identity is performatively constituted by the very 'expressions' that
> are said to be its results.[^03chapter2_25]

From this point of view, the poles between which the in-between
supposedly lies are only a *post hoc* projection, constructed after the
event. There is no white chair or blue chair but only a motion, a
process. Our language needs to discretize the continuity of the process
and hence describe it after the fact by postulating that there was a
white chair and then a blue chair. The two chairs are freeze frames,
abstract crystallizations of a continuous movement that resemble the
sampling of the aforementioned sound waves. In reality, there is only
the process. The instant in which the motion occurs is inhabited by a
force, a tension that cannot be essentialized. It isn't a 'thing' or a
space.

Clearly, it isn't easy to describe this motion using our language, with
its heavy essentialist burden; our words are also essentializations.
Plato's *exaiphnes* can be interpreted as an instant that eludes the
discretized timeline along which essences are strung. To describe the
same theoretical structure, Nietzsche used the term *das Tun*, Bergson
*élan*, Derrida *différance*.

If we bring this perspective to bear on our analysis of technology and
media, then the interface can no longer be understood as the point of
passage between two things. The interface becomes the only reality: the
two poles are produced retrospectively by the interface. Therefore,
mediation cannot be conceived as a negotiation between two ontologically
pre-existing poles, for those poles appear only belatedly, subsequent to
the action which actually occurs in the interface.

As we know, the word 'media' is often used to essentialize mediation and
frame it as a point of passage between two pre-existing poles. Rejecting
the previous poles leads us to conclude, in agreement with postmediatic
thinkers such as Galloway and Dworkin, that there is no such thing as
media; there are only practices. In this case, there is no longer an
in-between for there is nothing for it to be between. There is nothing
but action transpiring in the continuum of reality. It is only in
meeting the requirements of language that we crystallize actions by
freezing and naming them retrospectively. The naming of media – radio,
television, the Web, theater – is an example of this process. We shall
return to this point in Chapter 4.

As we have argued, assigning priority to action and refusing the
traditional concept of media probably constitutes the key shift in
intermedial studies in recent years and marks the transition from the
mediatic to the postmediatic phase. To sum up the logic of the
postmediatic approach, we might paraphrase Judith Butler by replacing
'gender' with 'media' in the passage we have quoted: 'There is no medium
behind the performance; media are performatively constituted by the very
expressions that are said to be their results'.

The concept of 'performativity' – which focuses our attention on the
action, on what is happening in the here and now, and links it to its
conditions of possibility – proceeds from the same logic as the concept
of media convergence that we defend here. The conditions from which it
emerged, the tensions from which it sprang and which it has spawned, are
akin to those that gave rise to both phases of intermedial thinking, and
can similarly be traced back to the Platonic intuition of the
*exaiphnes*.

## Performativity as a Component of Action

While the concept of performativity originally emerged in philosophy of
language, it bears relevance well beyond language, especially in the
field of theater. Performance studies have contributed to some of the
more promising theoretical developments of our day, as François Cusset
observes in *French Theory*.[^03chapter2_26] Cusset argues that the American
reception of the thinkers broadly referred to as 'structuralists' and
'poststructuralists' (notably Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Barthes)
sparked tremendous theoretical vitality in the United States while
stalling the debate in the French-speaking world. In the postscript to
the book's second edition, Cusset notes that the arrival of performance
studies in France at the end of the 2000s ushered in a renewal of
theoretical debate in the French-speaking world and is now driving an
international surge of new theoretical discussion. Performance studies
can therefore be regarded as one of the mainsprings of contemporary
theoretical reflection.

The concepts of performance and performativity[^03chapter2_27] are increasingly
gaining traction across fields of theoretical analysis: in theater,
literature, philosophy and political science. However, clear definitions
that would enable us to distinguish between the two and pin down their
respective meaning sometimes appear to be lacking. We will attempt to
elucidate such definitions here.

More specifically, we will look at what we have called 'action' and
examine the relationship between action and performativity. Every action
is determined to a greater or lesser degree. Depending on our analysis,
some actions may appear wholly determined, others entirely free. We have
discussed the concepts of premediation and affordance, and considered
how the types of determination they imply influence media devices. We
will now turn to the structure of action to seek the non-determined
element, the component of action that permits a margin of freedom. We
will call that element 'performativity', but we assign a more precise
meaning to the term than what we find in Austin or in performance
studies. To understand how mediation can be considered performative, we
must first develop a theoretical analysis of performativity as a
component of action, and define the difference between performativity
and performance.

In this discussion, it must be borne in mind that the determined and
non-determined elements of action cannot be separated in reality. This
is a discursive distinction that serves an epistemological function,
clarifying our understanding of the structure of action, and is not
rooted in any ontological divide.

## Drama and Performance

We will begin our dissection of action by returning to the theater and
demonstrating that action on stage illustrates more generally the
action's structure. Action in the theater presents us with an evident
paradox. On the one hand, we can think of it as the quintessential form
of action: overt, visible, public. At the same time, it appears fake and
fictional, which is why the word 'theatrical' has taken on a negative
connotation. What do actors do? According to one interpretation of
dramatic action, an actor does everything but act, in the sense of
performing an action. This is a striking contradiction: the word actor,
which specifically denotes the subject's relationship to action and
doing, also refers to an essentially passive function. Actors do not
act: they don't love, or kill, or die on the stage. Actors don't do
anything because everything has already been determined: the action on
the stage is not an original but a reproduction, a sham. It is a feigned
and deceptive 'liveness'. Theatricality, then, is a fiction, a form of
mimesis; it designates representation as opposed to presentation.

Another aspect of traditional drama is the degree to which the actors'
actions are determined. Everything is often decided in advance. Drama
consists in recreating, on the stage, something that has or could have
already occurred. The action happened in the past and is only evoked,
recalled, imitated in the theater. The script crystallizes and
standardizes the action. A flawless drama, then, is one in which nothing
happens: it is a perfect reproduction, a replica that is
indistinguishable from the original and, precisely for that reason,
entirely false.

Performance lies at the other end of the spectrum: there are no actors
in a performance precisely because there is action. The performer isn't
reproducing anything: she acts, she drinks, she eats, she loves, she
moves and she suffers.

But this opposition, which underpinned the abandonment of theatricality
in the theater in the 1980s and 1990s in favor of performativity, cannot
withstand scrutiny. The question of the determination or indetermination
of action is more complex and irreducible to any binary pair. The true
polarity – though strictly speaking it is no such thing, at least not in
the conventional sense of polarity – must be sought elsewhere, in the
opposition between the determination and performativity of action. Those
two elements, which coexist to varying degrees in any action, define
what happens on the stage as drama or performance. All theater is
partially determined, from the most faithful rendition of a script to
the most improvised performance.

What is true on the stage applies to all action. The dramatic model
calls for particularly standardized action, while the performative model
leaves more room for indetermination. But in every case, on or off the
stage, our actions contain an element of determination, which we shall
now consider in greater detail. That element of determination has
multiple and varied aspects, but we will confine ourselves to three that
we believe to be of particular importance: the spatial frame, the
symbolic context and the physical constraints. These factors all fit
into the framework that Grusin calls premediation.

When a stage is used for a play, a playground for a baseball game, a
classroom for a course or a bedroom for a nap, the spatial and
architectural environment limits and structures the action. The
architecture, understood in its broadest sense as the organization of
space, functions as an apparatus; it predetermines – and premediates –
the spectrum of possibilities. A chair predetermines the act of sitting
down, a door the act of opening and closing, and so forth. 'Natural'
spaces, necessarily perceived through a cultural lens, are also endowed
with this power of predetermination, lending them an architectural
dimension. A lake beckons us to swim in summer or skate in winter.

The second determinant is the symbolic context of the action. In the
case of the theater, it is what was written, put in place or more
generally planned prior to the drama or the performance, *i.e.* the
script. Outside the theater, the symbolic context may also be a 'script'
that structures and determines actions. That script consists of all the
texts that make up the social and cultural framework: mores, traditions,
the social apparatus.

Lastly, there is a series of mundane logical and physical necessities:
physiological requirements, physical forces and limitations, logical
principles (it cannot be raining and not raining at the same time).

These three factors, to which we shall return in the next chapter,
determine and circumscribe the action. From a strongly deterministic
point of view – such as the one implicit in the concept of apparatus as
defined by Bachimont – no non-determined space remains: if we knew all
the constraints, we would be able to predict every action. Spinoza's
*Ethics* provides a well-known example of this claim; for Spinoza, an
action is the result of all the constraints by which it is produced.
There is therefore a strict causal relationship between the preceding
situation and the ensuing action.

## The Temporal Structure of Action

Determinism can take various forms: physical (such as Laplacian
determinism, which holds that if we knew all the physical variables in
play at time T, we could predict the state of the world at time
T1),[^03chapter2_28] logical (Diodorus Cronus's master argument, according to
which, based simply on the principle of non-contradiction, we can
establish which propositions are true and which are false at any given
moment, and therefore into the future),[^03chapter2_29] or fatalistic (there is a
predetermined ending, like the script of a play).

All these varieties of determinism are rooted in a specific
interpretation of the time sequence in which the action is embedded.
They assume linear time, consisting in a series of discrete units from
which particular moments, linked by the principle of causality – a
string of cause-effect relationships – can be picked out. In other
words, the deterministic conception of action is entrenched in an
essentialist understanding of reality: there is a 'before' – the script
– and an 'after' – the playing out of the script. We therefore return to
the two poles discussed earlier, and the essentialist perspective
postulating that they are ontological precedents to the in-between that
connects them.

Ontologically, then, the essence of the 'before' – the script – and the
'after' – the performance – must already be given, prior to any action.
To stage a drama, there must already be a script and an idea of what it
would and should look like when performed on the stage. From an
ontological point of view, the two poles have priority over the action
on the stage that runs counter to our conception of the chronology of
action.

Approaching the question from a chronological angle, Paul Ricoeur
describes a sequence of mimetic action consisting of an original, a
mediation, and then a copy. There is an initial pole (the original) and
it is from the mediation – the in-between – that the second (the 'copy',
or the representation) springs. But while there is a shift in
perspective between the ontological and chronological points of view,
they spring from the same essentialist conception of the order of
things. Both rest on the discretization of reality and agree on the
primacy of objects.

These two foundation blocks are the nub of the problem. By positing the
existence of two poles, the essentialist approach forces us to attach
the action to one of them, specifically the second, the one that comes
chronologically after the first. The action is understood as the simple
effect of a determining cause. Applied to the theater, this logic casts
the performance – determined by that which preceded it and is its cause,
namely the script – as the action.

But how can we conceive of the script as a separate, pre-existing
entity? Contrary to Barthes, recent work in dramaturgy by Joseph Danan
convincingly shows that the script also fully participates in
theatricality; it already bears within itself the conditions of its
performance. In a way, it is a product of the performance because, to
enlist Grusin's concept once again, it is 'premediated'.

If removing the script from the creative dynamic to which it belongs
served only to reify a gesture, the consequences would be relatively
limited. But the attempt to fragment a flow, to oppose action and
object, to separate the inseparable, which is characteristic of the
essentialist approach, has more dire effects. Those consequences urge a
non-essentialist position which holds that script and performance can be
discussed only from the standpoint of action: there is no object outside
the action, and for there to be an object, there must be an action. For
there to be a script, there must be the action of writing, or reading,
or playing.

Returning to the example of the chair, there aren't two chairs and
something that connects them. There is only an action, the act of
painting a chair blue. It is the only reality. The two chairs, white and
blue, are discursive constructs. They are a response to the action of
painting, a *post hoc* mental configuration. Similarly, it could be said
that in the theater the action is not the performance of a script but
what happens on the stage, from which script and performance emerge to
form a dynamic, indivisible whole.

Clearly, the non-essentialist approach poses a major challenge, for the
real, continuous instant in which the action occurs is ungraspable and
undefinable. It remains mysterious and escapes all the varieties of
determinism implied by essentialist thinking. It is in this instant – in
the *exaiphnes* – that the performativity of each action is to be found.

We propose to further develop this perspective and frame a different,
non-essentialist, non-deterministic conception of action and hence of
mediation. To do so, we must first define the difference between
'performance' and 'performativity', which are often confused.
Performance is an artistic rendering while performativity is a property
of action. Any action is, to some degree, performative.

## The Undecided

Performativity is the element of each action that eludes determination.
It is what happens in the instant of action that could not have been
foreseen. Let's return to the example of traditional drama, which would
appear to be the least performative variety of action, since everything
seems to have been planned in advance (barring an element of
improvisation). The actors recite the text without changing a word. They
have rehearsed it many times to find the best delivery, and just the
right intonation, for each line. Their movements were blocked
beforehand. And yet, in the moment when they are on stage, acting,
something happens that transcends the predictable. A singular tension is
created precisely because what happens on the stage is happening
*there*, and no amount of rehearsal can strip that moment of a margin of
unpredictability. There is always a gap between what was determined and
what occurs in the *exaiphnes* of the action. It is in this sense that
an actor acts. All was decided and yet an undecided slice remains. That
space is precisely the locus of performativity, for the undecided
element is what remains to be determined, what remains open,
unpredictable.

There are therefore two distinct but complementary ways to view an
action. From an essentialist position that conceives of reality as
discrete, we may focus on what predetermines an action, or we can try to
understand it as part of the flow of reality, as that which fills the
*exaiphnes* and always remains undecided.

Clearly, both positions are tenable. It cannot be denied that every
action is determined and, at the same time, retains a margin of
indecision. But viewing action from the standpoint of performativity is,
first and foremost, an ethical and political imperative. Those twin
demands prompt us to redefine our terms. From a theoretical point of
view, we may choose the approach that suits us best and focus on
analyzing the determinants of action to understand its causes, if choose
to. From a political point of view, we need to seek the performative
element of action because that is where we will find the zone of freedom
and responsibility. We cannot be responsible for something that has
already been determined, but only for what is as yet undecided, where
our actions can sway the outcome. Responsibility prevails in the
*exaiphnes*: only in the non-determined space where I enjoy a margin of
freedom can I be accountable.

From the ethical point of view, the key question is: precisely what
remains undecided? The ethical approach probes the performative aspect
of an action to delineate the zone of freedom in which responsibility is
possible. If we are not responsible for what has already happened, for
what is finished and immutable, but only for what can still be done
differently, then performativity is the condition of possibility for
ethical choice.

Viewed through a political lens, all norms and apparatus of power are
determinants of action. But an action can have no political significance
if it is entirely controlled by those norms and apparatus: it assumes
political meaning when it seeks the empty space, the zone of indecision
that allows for creative normativity. Performativity disturbs norms
because it overflows from their determinative power and produces
something new, unexpected and therefore, to some degree, subversive.

These ethical and political considerations are the rationale behind the
narrower sense we assign to the term performativity. First, it is
important to detach performativity from performance as an artistic
practice, although the two are historically linked, and to distinguish
between the two meanings of 'performative', wherein one is bound up with
performativity and the other with performance. In common parlance,
performativity and performative relate to the general idea of action in
progress, of that which is being done. Indeed, 'performativity' and
'action' are often used interchangeably. This very broad usage is
problematic. While every action has a performative dimension, the
performative is not coextensive with action. In our definition,
performativity denotes only the undecided component of action, which is
also its normative component, in the sense that instead of perpetuating
existing norms, it produces new ones.

By thus distinguishing action from performativity, we can avoid the
debate about the determination and indetermination of performativity
that Judith Butler sums up in *Excitable Speech*.[^03chapter2_30] She outlines the
limits of the approach that originated with J.L. Austin's *How To Do
Things With Words*,[^03chapter2_31] a seminal text in the development of
performance studies. For Austin, utterances are performative when they
'do' an action that has been predetermined by the situation in which
they occur. The sentence 'I pronounce you husband and wife' is
performative because it creates a marriage, in accordance with the
pre-existing codes and conventions that determine what a marriage is and
how it is contracted.

Butler argues that the performative can, on the contrary, produce
something novel, something that transcends and challenges the situation
in which it occurs. But this does not mean the situation imposes no
limits. For Butler, there is an interplay between situational
determination and norm-creation in the performative.

We agree that action has a dual nature, but we will use the term
'performative' to refer only to its non-determined side. As we have
argued, the line between the two components can be drawn only
discursively, for the performative and the determined cannot be sundered
in reality. Nevertheless, we must consider them separately if, for
ethical or political reasons, we wish to examine the undecided element
of action.

## Mediation as Performativity

What does this perspective mean for mediation? We have seen the
essentialist and non-essentialist interpretations of the term. From a
non-essentialist point of view, mediation is a way to understand the
*exaiphnes* as an instant that belongs to neither the before, nor the
after. Mediation is what happens in the moment: it is the creative
instant of action. In this sense, it is pure performativity.

From an essentialist point of view, mediation can be described as
something between two moments, two objects, and so forth. There is a
moment A and a moment B; and mediation is the path from one to the
other. Thus, as we have discussed, mediation is itself essentialized and
reduced to a determined, pre-established apparatus. In the process, the
indecision that inhabits the moment of mediation is lost.

Let us take an interface as an example. It can be described in two
opposing ways. From the determinist / essentialist point of view, it is
what lies between code and user. The code and the user were already
there, determined and well-defined. The interface links them but is
wholly determined by the nature of the two things it connects. The code
is already written, the user is already in front of the screen with
expectations, abilities and needs. From the characteristics of code and
user, we can deduce the interface. Its function is pre-established: what
happens in the mediation reproduces what was already plotted. Similarly,
the essentialization of the interface compels us to conceive the action
that occurs within it as entirely determined – by its premediation, by
its affordance, by the fact that it is an apparatus, in Bachimont's
sense.

If our interest is in the undecided element, we must frame the picture
differently. Mediation becomes the starting point of the analysis, for
it is all we have. In the *exaiphnes*, there is neither user nor code,
but only the interface. The user and the code are produced by the
interface: they make their appearance only because there is an interface
that connects them. All that seemed to be decided and determined is in
fact open: the mediation is located in the undecided zone and is
therefore performative. Or, more precisely, the mediation contains
premediated and undecided aspects that are ontologically inseparable,
but we must consider them separately in order to distinguish the element
of freedom in every action.

This approach is particularly pertinent to the analysis of digital
practices, as shall be seen in the final chapter. Much of the discussion
around information technologies has centered on their normative
dimension, how algorithms and technical devices premediate action to the
point of transforming users into automatons.[^03chapter2_32] But while focusing on
the predetermined aspect of technological practices illuminates a basic
feature of their operation, it is politically perilous, as it forecloses
responsibility and gives rise to a discourse imbued with paternalism. It
is true that any use of a platform is premediated by its structure, but
there are also emancipatory possibilities insofar as our behaviours can
etch new norms for that platform. We are conditioned, to be sure, but we
also condition at the same time. We may be exploited, but that
exploitation bears within itself the potential for normative agency.

In the following chapter, we explore this idea and illustrate the
relationship between mediation and performativity, which we will attempt
to elucidate using the concept of mediating conjunctures.

[^03chapter2_16]: We use the English word 'apparatus' for the French word
    'dispositif' following the translators of Giorgio Agamben,
    *Qu'est-ce qu'un dispositif?*, Paris: Payot & Rivages, 2007,
    translated: Giorgio Agamben, *'What Is an Apparatus?' And Other
    Essays*, Meridian, Crossing Aesthetics, Stanford, Calif: Stanford
    University Press, 2009. This word can be translated in many
    different ways: 'apparatus', 'device', 'machinery', 'construction'
    or 'deployment'. After the definition of this concept by Michel
    Foucault and others, *Dits et écrits, 1954-1988. II, II,* \[Paris\]:
    Gallimard, 2001, the term has been used by many scholars with
    differents meanings. See, for example: Arnaud Rykner, *Le tableau
    vivant et la scène du corps : vision, pulsion, dispositif*, Hyper
